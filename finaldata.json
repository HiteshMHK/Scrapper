The survey aims to improve the quality and availability of portfolio investment statistics, specifically holdings of equity and investment fund shares, long-term debt securities, and short-term debt securities. Eligible entities such as banks, mutual fund companies, non-financial companies, non-banking financial companies, and insurance companies are surveyed semi-annually to report their portfolio investment assets. The RBI notifies the entities via email about the launch of the survey, and the entities submit the filled survey schedule to the RBI. The data collected is kept confidential, and only consolidated aggregates are shared with the IMF. The survey requires reporting entities to provide complete and accurate information in the specified format, and the deadline for participation is usually July 15 and December 31 for the respective reporting periods. For further queries, entities can contact the International Investment Position Division of the RBI.\nReserve Bank of India\nGeneral Information\nThe Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) is a voluntary data collection exercise conducted under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The purpose of the CPIS is to improve the quality of portfolio investment statistics in the international investment position (IIP)\u2014that is, holdings of portfolio investment assets in the form of equity and investment fund shares, long-term debt securities, and short-term debt securities \u2014 and the availability of these statistics by counterpart economies.

What are equity securities?\nAns:\u00a0Equity consists of all instruments and records that acknowledge claims on the residual value of a corporation or quasi-corporation, after the claims of all creditors have been met. Equity may be split into listed shares, unlisted shares, and other equity. Both listed and unlisted shares are equity securities. Equity securities are commonly called shares or stocks.

What are debt securities?\nAns:\u00a0Debt securities are negotiable instruments serving as evidence of a debt. They include bills, bonds, notes, negotiable certificates of deposit, commercial paper, debentures, asset-backed securities, money market instruments, and similar instruments normally traded in the financial markets.\nQ20. What are long-term debt securities?\nAns:\u00a0Debt securities with\u00a0original maturity of more than one year\u00a0is classified as long-term debt securities. These include bonds, debentures, and notes that usually give the holder the unconditional right to a fixed cash flow or contractually determined variable money income.\nQ21. What are short-term debt securities?\nAns:\u00a0Debt securities with\u00a0original maturity of one year or less\u00a0is classified as short-term debt securities. Examples of short-term securities are treasury bills, negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019 acceptances, promissory notes, and commercial paper.\nQ22. At what value should we report the securities \u2013 face value or market value?\nAns:\u00a0Equity securities should be reported at\u00a0market prices converted to domestic currency\u00a0using the exchange rate prevailing at March 31/ September 30, [Year]. For enterprises listed on a stock exchange, the market value of your holding of the equity securities should be calculated using the market price on the main stock exchange prevailing at March 31/ September 30, [Year]. For unlisted enterprises, if a market value is not available at the close of business on March 31/ September 30, [Year], estimate of the market value of your holding of equity securities can be calculated by using one of the six alternatives methods given in Q23.\nDebt securities\u00a0should be recorded at\u00a0market prices converted to domestic currency, using the exchange rate prevailing at the close of business on March 31/ September 30, [Year]. For listed debt securities, a quoted traded market price at the close of business on March 31/ September 30, [Year], should be used. When market prices are unavailable (e.g., in the case of unlisted debt securities), the following methods for estimating fair value (which is an approximation of the market value of such instruments) should be used:\n\ndiscounting future cash flows to the present value using a market rate of interest and\nusing market prices of financial assets and liabilities that are similar.\n\nQ23. What is the method that can be used for approximating market prices for equity securities?\nAns:\u00a0When actual market values are not available, an estimate is required. Alternative methods of approximating market value of shareholders\u2019 equity in a direct investment enterprise include the following:\na. Recent transaction price: Unlisted instruments may trade from time to time, and recent prices, within the past year, at which they were traded may be used. Recent prices are a good indicator of current market values to the extent that conditions are unchanged. This method can be used as long as there has been no material change in the corporation\u2019s position since the transaction date. Recent transaction prices become increasingly misleading as time passes and conditions change.\nb. Net asset value: Appraisals of untraded equity may be conducted by knowledgeable management or directors of the enterprise or provided by independent auditors to obtain total assets at current value less total liabilities (excluding equity) at market value. Valuations should be recent (within the past year) and should preferably include intangible assets.\nc. Present value and price-to-earnings ratios: The present value of unlisted equity can be estimated by discounting the forecast future profits. At its simplest, this method can be approximated by applying a market or industry price-to-earnings ratio to the (smoothed) recent past earnings of the unlisted enterprise to calculate a price. This method is most appropriate in which there is a paucity of balance sheet information but earnings data are more readily available.\nd. Market capitalization method: Book values reported by enterprises can be adjusted at an aggregate level by the statistical compiler. For untraded equity, information on \u201cown funds at book value\u201d can be collected from enterprises, and then adjusted with ratios based on suitable price indicators, such as the ratio of market capitalization to book value for listed companies in the same economy with similar operations. Alternatively, assets that enterprises carry at cost (such as land, plant, equipment, and inventories) can be revalued to current period prices using suitable asset price indices.\ne. Own funds at book value: This method for valuing equity uses the value of the enterprise recorded in the books of the direct investment enterprise, as the sum of (a) paid-up capital (excluding any shares on issue that the enterprise holds in itself and including share premium accounts); (b) all types of reserves identified as equity in the enterprise\u2019s balance sheet (including investment grants when accounting guidelines consider them company reserves); (c) cumulated reinvested earnings; and (d) holding gains or losses included in own funds in the accounts, whether as revaluation reserves or profits or losses. The more frequent the revaluation of assets and liabilities, the closer the approximation to market values. Data that are not revalued for several years may be a poor reflection of market values.\nf. Apportioning global value: The current market value of the global enterprise group can be based on the market price of its shares on the exchange on which its equity is traded, if it is a listed company. Where an appropriate indicator may be identified (e.g., sales, net income, assets, or employment), the global value may be apportioned to each economy in which it has direct investment enterprises, on the basis of that indicator, by making the assumption that the ratio of net market value to sales, net income, assets, or employment is a constant throughout the transnational enterprise group. (Each indicator could yield significantly different results from the others).\nContact Details for query related to CPIS\nQ24. Whom to contact in case of any query related to the CPIS?\nAns:\u00a0Queries/clarifications on CPIS may be sought from the RBI at the following address:\nInternational Investment Position Division (IIPD)\nDepartment of Statistics and Information Management (DSIM)\nReserve Bank of India\nC-9/5 th Floor, Bandra \u2013 Kurla Complex, Bandra East\nMumbai, Maharashtra \u2013 400 051\nEmail\u00a0\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/lei-registration-checklist-obtain-legal-entity-identifier.html", "title": "LEI Registration Checklist: Obtain Your Legal Entity Identifier", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a crucial code consisting of 20 symbols that facilitates identification within the global financial system. LEIs have become mandatory for legal entities engaged in trading securities, as mandated by MiFID II and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In this guide, we present the checklist of mandatory documents required for registering and obtaining an LEI.\nAccording to the Mifid (Financail Market Instruments Directive) II directive 2014/65/EL, LEI codes are mandatory for all legal entities who trade in securities. The Reserve Bank of India has mandated the use of LEIs by all companies trading in OTC markets for Rupee Interest Rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives and credit derivatives in India. Mandatory use of LEIs was phased in between August 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, as per the RBI Notification dated June 1, 2017.\nAccording to the MiFID II directive, LEIs are mandatory as of 3 January 2018 for all market participants with a separate legal entity that trades in securities. For example, if a company is registered in India and would like to buy local stocks then, as of 3 January 2018, it is mandatory for this company to have LEI.\nThe purpose of LEI codes is to make it easier to identify counterparty in financial transactions. The issuance of codes is regulated by the global umbrella organization GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation)\n\nAn LEI or Legal Entity Identifier is a unique code, consisting of 20 symbols, that allows for identification within the global financial system. An LEI code is issued to a company just once and is unique.\nThe LEI code is valid for 1 year from the date of issue. The code must then be extended (via a renewal application) for the following year.\n\n\u00a0Why do we need an LEI code?\nCompanies that operate within jurisdictions that mandate the use of LEIs will need to obtain one before they are allowed to transact on the financial market within that jurisdiction. The RBI has mandated the use of LEIs by large corporate borrowers and legal entities operating within certain financial markets.\nAnnexed herewith, set of documents required for registration under LEI.\n\n\nMandatory Documents for Identity Verification\n\n\n\nSr. no.\nParticulars \nOptional/Mandatory\nChecklist (please \u2714documents ready to submit to LEIL)\n\n\n1\nMCA Registration Certificate containing CIN number.

Under this scheme, individuals can remit up to USD 250,000 per financial year for current account transactions and permissible capital account transactions.\nSection 206C of the Income Tax Act requires tax collection by sellers for certain transactions, including the sale of alcohol, liquor, forest produce, scrap, and more. Sub-section (1G) of Section 206C specifically covers tax collection on foreign remittances made under the LRS and the sale of Overseas Tour Program Packages (OTPP).\nThe Finance Act of 2023 has introduced significant changes to the tax collection provisions under Section 206C(1G). The tax collected at source (TCS) rate for specified remittances under LRS and overseas tour program packages has been revised to 20%, effective from July 1, 2023, replacing the previous rate of 5% applicable until June 30, 2023.\nTo address practical difficulties arising from the removal of the threshold for LRS payments, the Ministry of Finance, through a press release dated June 28, 2023, and CBDT Circular 10 dated June 30, 2023, has provided certain relaxations. The implementation of the increased TCS rate has been postponed to October 1, 2023. Therefore, the revised TCS rates, originally set to take effect from July 1, 2023, will now be implemented from October 1, 2023. The earlier rates will continue to apply until September 30, 2023.\nUnder the revised provisions, the threshold of Rs. 7 lakh per financial year per individual in clause (i) of sub-section (1G) of Section 206C will be restored for TCS on all categories of LRS payments, regardless of the purpose and mode of payment. This means that no TCS will be applicable for the first Rs. 7 lakh remittance under LRS. Beyond this threshold, the TCS rates will be as follows:\n\n\na) 0.5% (for remittances for education financed by a loan from a financial institution)\nb) 5% (for remittances for education or medical treatment)\nc) 20% (for all other purposes)\nFor the purchase of overseas tour program packages under clause (ii) of sub-section (1G) of Section 206C, the TCS rate will continue to be 5% for the first Rs. 7 lakh per individual per annum. The 20% rate will apply only for expenditure above this limit.\nThereby, the effective rates of TCS will be as follows:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTCS rate till 30.09.2023\nTCS rate with effect from 01.10.2023\n\n\n\u00a0\nExemption limit\nRate\nExemption limit\nRate\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution.\n7 lakhs\n0.5%\n7 lakhs\n0.5%\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above\n7 lakhs\n5%\n7 lakhs\n5%\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment\n7 lakhs\n5%\n7 lakhs\n5%\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc\n7 lakhs\n5%\n7 lakhs\n20%\n\n\nPurchase of overseas tour program package\nNIL\n5%\nNil\n5% till Rs. 7 lakhs.\n20% Above Rs. 7 lakhs.\n\n\n\nThe table clearly indicates that there will be a change in the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rate for the sale of overseas tour program packages and remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), effective from October 1, 2023. The new rate will be 20% instead of the current 5%, except for medical and education loan purposes.\nCredit Card transactions done abroad are excluded from LRS Coverage\nIt is important to note that credit card transactions made abroad are not covered under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).\nPreviously, the government issued Notification No. GSR 369(E) dated 16-05-2023, stating that the usage of International Credit Cards (ICC) while abroad would be governed by the LRS. According to this notification, the limit for using an International Credit Card during foreign travel would be capped at USD 250,000 and would be subject to the Tax Collected at Source (TCS).\nTo address procedural uncertainties and allow sufficient time for banks and card networks to implement the necessary IT solutions, the government, through a press release dated June 28, 2023, decided to postpone the implementation of the May 16, 2023 e-gazette notification. This means that transactions made through international credit cards while overseas will not be considered under the LRS and therefore will not be subject to the TCS. The press release dated May 19, 2023, is no longer applicable.\n\n\nThere are two independent threshold limits regarding the TCS applicability and the purchase of overseas tour program packages. For LRS, the threshold is Rs. 7 lakh, and any remittance above this limit would make the TCS applicable. Similarly, for the purchase of overseas tour program packages, there is also a threshold of Rs. 7 lakh, which determines the applicable TCS rate as either 5% or 20%.\nIs the Rs. 7 Lakh Exemption Threshold Limit Qua the Remitter or Qua the Authorised Dealer?\nThe exemption threshold limit of Rs. 7 lakhs in relation to LRS remittances for medical treatment and/or education abroad is considered in reference to the resident individual (remitter) and not the Authorized Dealer. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) compiles and monitors the aggregate LRS spends of resident individuals in a financial year based on their PAN (Permanent Account Number).\nIf a resident individual conducts LRS transactions through multiple authorized dealers/bankers or international debit/credit cards, the threshold exemption limit of Rs. 7 lakhs within a year will be calculated based on the total amount spent across all authorized dealers/bankers. It is not assessed independently for each authorized dealer/banker.\nConclusion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to clarify the confusion surrounding the TCS on international credit card usage. The government\u2019s press release dated June 28, 2023, along with the CBDT Circular dated June 30, 2023, has introduced several changes to the TCS provisions. As a result, transactions made by Indian residents while traveling abroad using their international credit cards will not be considered under the LRS and will not attract TCS. The LRS facilitates such transactions seamlessly while also safeguarding the country\u2019s foreign exchange against instability. Residents and entrepreneurs should familiarize themselves with the intricacies of the LRS to have a smooth remittance experience and optimize their foreign exchange dealings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBDT Circular \u2013\u00a0FAQs on TCS on LRS and purchase of overseas tour program package\n*****\nCA Dhanush D Bolar | Partner | Nitin J Shetty and Co, Chartered Accountants\n", "table": ["\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **TCS rate till 30.09.2023** | **TCS rate with effect from 01.10.2023** |\n|  | **Exemption limit** | **Rate** | **Exemption limit** | **Rate** |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution. | 7 lakhs | 0.5% | 7 lakhs | 0.5% |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above | 7 lakhs | 5% | 7 lakhs | 5% |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment | 7 lakhs | 5% | 7 lakhs | 5% |\n| LRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc | 7 lakhs | 5% | 7 lakhs | 20% |\n| Purchase of overseas tour program package | NIL | 5% | Nil | 5% till Rs. 7 lakhs.\n20% Above Rs. 7 lakhs. |\n\n"], "table_c": ["<table style=\"height: 770px;\" width=\"554\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"187\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"182\"><strong>TCS rate till 30.09.2023</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"216\"><strong>TCS rate with effect from 01.10.2023</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></td>\n<td width=\"96\"><strong>Exemption limit</strong></td>\n<td width=\"86\"><strong>Rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"122\"><strong>Exemption limit</strong></td>\n<td width=\"95\"><strong>Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution.</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">0.5%</td>\n<td width=\"122\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"95\">0.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"122\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"95\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"122\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"95\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"122\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"95\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">Purchase of overseas tour program package</td>\n<td width=\"96\">NIL</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"122\">Nil</td>\n<td width=\"95\">5% till Rs. 7 lakhs.<p></p>\n<p>20% Above Rs. 7 lakhs.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"]}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/overseas-direct-investment-fema-compliance-indiaoverseas-direct-investment-odi-compliances-in-india-as-per-fema-rules-regulations.html", "title": "Overseas Direct Investment: FEMA Compliance Rules for Indian Entities", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverseas Direct Investment (ODI) Compliances in India As Per FEMA Rules & Regulations\nOverseas Direct Investments (ODIs) can serve as a catalyst for Indian companies, offering them an avenue to expand into international markets. However, navigating the labyrinth of regulations can be challenging. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) has established a regulatory framework to manage such overseas transactions. This article aims to be your definitive guide to understanding and navigating these complex rules to make your overseas investment journey smooth.\nPage Contents1. Preliminary Requirements2. Reporting and Documentation3. Financial Sources and Restrictions4. Penalties and Additional Considerations5. Conclusion\n1. Preliminary Requirements\nNo Objection Certificate (NOC) with AD Bank\nBefore venturing into ODIs, individuals or entities that are defaulters with any bank, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), or Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) must secure a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from an Authorized Dealer (AD) Bank. This is a mandatory clearance to ensure that individuals or companies with adverse financial or criminal histories do not engage in foreign investments.\n\nForm FC and Unique Identification Number (UIN)\nForm FC, replete with requisite documentation, must be submitted to the AD Bank for acquiring a Unique Identification Number (UIN). The UIN acts as a unique identifier for the Indian entity making the investment, enabling the RBI to track the transaction. The AD Bank, after due verification, will process the transactions only upon the issuance of this UIN.\n2. Reporting and Documentation\nAnnual Performance Report (APR)\nThe APR should be submitted by December 31 each year for every foreign entity where an investment has been made. However, exemptions are available. For instance, no APR is required for entities where the Indian investor holds less than 10% equity and has no other financial commitment.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/Audited and Unaudited Financial Statements\nWhile the APR generally requires audited financial statements, there are exceptions. For example, if the Indian entity doesn\u2019t control the foreign company, and if the host country\u2019s laws don\u2019t mandate auditing, unaudited financials are acceptable.\nJoint Reporting\nFor foreign entities where multiple Indian residents have invested, the APR submission duty falls on the individual holding the majority stake. In instances where stake ownership is equal, joint filing of the APR is permitted.\nEvidence of Investment\nDocumentation substantiating the overseas investment must be submitted to the AD Bank within a stipulated timeframe of six months.\n3. Financial Sources and Restrictions\nInternal Accruals vs. Borrowed Funds\nWhen it comes to foreign start-ups, the Indian entity must finance the investment from its internal accruals. Borrowing funds for this purpose is explicitly disallowed.\nNo Cash Investments\nThe regulatory framework clearly states that any form of cash investment is strictly prohibited. All transactions must occur through legitimate banking channels.\n4. Penalties and Additional Considerations\nLate Submission Fees (LSF)\nDelayed reporting or documentation can result in late submission fees, which can be significant.\nLiberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)\nUnder the LRS, individual residents can invest up to $250,000 annually in foreign entities.\nTax Collected at Source (TCS)\nEffective October 1, 2023, a 20% TCS is applicable for any remittance exceeding Rs 7 lakhs. This is a significant hike from the earlier rate of 5%.\n5. Conclusion\nUnderstanding and adhering to FEMA guidelines is not merely a regulatory requirement but also a pathway to successfully unlocking the potential that overseas markets offer. From the initial stages of obtaining necessary clearances like NOCs and UINs, to fulfilling ongoing compliance like APRs and audited financial statements, each step is designed to ensure the integrity and transparency of overseas investments made by Indian entities. Compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it\u2019s about enabling businesses to capitalize fully on their overseas ventures. Therefore, diligent attention to these rules is both a requirement and a strategy for success in the global arena.\n\n\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/biennial-survey-foreign-collaboration-indian-industry-fcs.html", "title": "Biennial survey on Foreign Collaboration in Indian Industry (FCS)", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve Bank conducts the Foreign Collaborations and Services (FCS) Survey, which serves as a valuable tool for researchers and industries alike. This survey provides insights into areas of potential competition and captures a wide range of performance indicators and technology transfer agreements. It is conducted biennially for Indian direct investment companies with foreign technical collaboration agreements. The survey is launched through RBI press releases and email notifications, with reporting entities submitting filled-in survey schedules via email. The data is analyzed internally, and aggregated results are published on the RBI website. The confidentiality of company-wise information is maintained, and only consolidated aggregates are released. Reporting entities must carefully follow the instructions while filling the survey schedule, and the survey schedule must be submitted in Excel format. The FCS survey is typically launched in June, with a submission deadline of July 15.\nGeneral Instructions\nThe Reserve Bank has been conducting FCS Survey for a long time because it is not only beneficial for the researchers but also helpful for the industries as it gives them an idea of the potential areas of competition.

"RBI guidelines to Banks, NBFCs on Penal Charges", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, customer complaints against banks have gone up manifold. These complaints include miss-selling of insurance policies, unfair recovery tactics, hidden charges and failure to convey reduction in loan interest rates etc. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken a proactive part in order to address these concerns by issuing regular guidelines and directives that Banks are obligated to adhere to. These guidelines aim to promote fair practices within the banking sector.\nA prominent issue raised against banks was the levy of multiple charges in case of delayed payments. When customers failed to make payments on time, the Bank would impose penal charges on the customer. Additionally, they would also impose penal interest on these delayed payments. These accumulated charges would continue to grow, attracting additional interest.\u00a0 As a result, borrowers who were already facing financial difficulties would find themselves in a vicious debt cycle.\nIn a development that aims to redefine lending practices in the Indian Banking Sector, the RBI took a significant step by issuing a set of directives that prohibited Banks from charging penal interest rate on loans. The regulator has also made it clear that Banks are only permitted to impose penalties in case of non-adherence to the agreed upon terms and conditions. Penalty, if charged for non-adherence of material terms and conditions outlined in the loan agreement by the borrower, shall be treated as \u201cpenal charges\u201d and shall not be levied in the form of \u201cpenal interest\u201d that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances.\n\nTake for example, a firm that has availed a working capital arrangement at an 11% interest rate from a Bank. As per the standard terms of this loan, the firm must provide a stock statement every month so that its drawing power can be fixed. If the stock statement is not submitted promptly, the Bank had the authority to increase the interest rate from 11% to 12%, with the additional 1% being the penal interest. However, now the RBI wants Banks to transition from levying penal interest to levying penal charges for non-compliance with material terms and conditions.\nThe RBI has made it clear that the intent of levying penal charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and that such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the agreed interest. The RBI guidelines mandated Regulated Entities to formulate a board approved policy on penal charges. The quantum of penal charges should be reasonable and commensurate with the non-compliance of material terms and conditions of the loan agreement, without being biased within a specific type of loan or product category.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds byFurther, the penal charges applicable to individual borrowers shall not be higher than the penal charges that are applicable to non-individual borrowers for similar non-compliance to of material terms and conditions. The quantum and reason for the penal charges shall be clearly disclosed to the customers in the loan agreement, in addition to it being displayed on the website of the bank under \u201cinterest rates and charges\u201d.\nMoreover, wherever reminders for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of the loan are sent to the borrower, the applicable penal charges shall also be communicated. Further, any\ninstance of levy of penal charges and the reason thereof shall also be communicated to the customer.\nThe RBI Guidelines on penal charges will lead to the following:\na. Ensure that the customer is protected from falling into a debt trap due to accumulating penal interest and penal charges\nb. Promote fair lending practices within all the regulated entities\nc. Make borrowing more accessible and inclusive\nd. Have a positive influence on the credit score.\nIn conclusion, the RBI decision to bar banks from charging penal interest on loans is a step in creating a more equitable and borrower centric lending environment. It demonstrates the RBI\u2019s commitment to protecting consumers, promoting responsible lending, and contributing to the overall financial wellbeing of individuals and businesses.\n\n\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/liberalized-remittance-scheme-lrs-residents-india.html", "title": "25 FAQ\u2019s on Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) for Resident of India", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A) LRS for foreign remittances by RoI\u00a0 \n1.

implementation of changes for Tax Collection at Source (TCS) for remittances under Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) + also for purchase of overseas tour program package (both).\n\n1. Finance Act, 2023 has amended sub-section (1G) of section 206C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Act\u2019) to, intera/ia ,\n(i) increase the rate of Tax Collection at Source (TCS) from 5% to 20% for remittance under LRS as well as for purchase of overseas tour program package; and\n(ii) remove the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for triggering TCS on LRS.\nThese two changes did not apply when the remittance is for education and medical purpose.\n2. Subsequently, the Government had notified Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) (Amendment) Rules, 2023 vide an e-gazette notification dated 16th May, 2023 to remove the differential treatment for credit cards vis a vis other modes of drawal of foreign exchange under This change has now been postponed for the time being.\n3. Comments were received about the practical difficulties that may arise from the removal of the threshold for LRS payments other than for education and medical treatment. During meetings with the RBI, Banks and Card networks, some financial institutions have desired more time to modify their current IT systems to address issues arising from the implementation of the provision of TCS on credit card transactions.\n4. In order to address these issues, a Press Release dated 28.6.2023 (copy enclosed) was issued by Ministry of Finance wherein the following decisions relating to income-tax have been taken:\n(i) Threshold of Rs. 7 lakh per financial year per individual in clause (i) of sub\u00ad section (1G) of section 206C shall be restored for TCS on all categories of LRS payments, through all modes of payment, regardless of the purpose: Thus, for first Rs 7 lakh remittance under LRS there shall be no TCS. Beyond this Rs 7 lakh threshold, TCS shall be at the rate of-\na) 0.5% (if remittance for education is financed by loan taken from a financial institution);\nb) 5% (in case of remittance for education/medical treatment);\nc) 20% for\nFor purchase of overseas tour program package under clause (ii) of sub-section (1G) of section 206C, the TCS shall continue to apply at the rate of 5% for the first Rs 7 lakh per individual per annum; the 20% rate will only apply for expenditure above this limit.\n(ii) Increased TCS rates to apply from 1st October, 2023: The increase in TCS rates; which were to come into effect from 1st July, 2023 shall now come into effect from 1st October, 2023 with the modification as in (i) above. Till 30th September, 2023, earlier rates (prior to amendment by the Finance Act, 2023) shall continue to apply.\n5. Earlier and new TCS rates are summarised as under:\n\n\n\n\nNature of payment\n(1)\n\nEarlier rate before Finance Act, 2023\n(2)\nNew rate w.e.f 1st October, 2023\n(3)\n\n\nLRS for education, financed by loan from financial institution\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 0.5% above Rs 7 lakh\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 0.5% above Rs 7 lakh\n\n\nLRS for Medical treatment! education (other than financed by loan)\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 5% above Rs 7 lakh\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 5% above Rs 7 lakh\n\n\nLRS for other purposes\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 5% above Rs 7 lakh\nNil upto Rs 7 lakh 20% above Rs 7 lakh\n\n\nPurchase of Overseas tour program package\n5% (without threshold)\n5% till Rs 7 lakh, 20% thereafter\n\n\n\n*Note:\n(i) TCS rate mentioned in column 2 shall cont1nue to apply till 30th September, 2023.\n(ii) There shall be no TCS on expenditure under LRS under clause (i) of sub\u00ad section (1G) of section 206C upto Rs 7 lakh, irrespective of purpose.\n6. Sub-section (1-1) of section 206C of the Act provides that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of sub-section (1G) of this section, the Board may, with the approval of the Central Government, issue guidelines for the purpose of removing the difficulty. Accordingly, the following guideline is issued under this provision.\nFAQ 1: Whether payment through overseas credit card would be counted in LRS ?\nAns.1: As announced in the press release dated 28th June, 2023, the classification of use of international credit card while being overseas, as LRS is postpored.\nTherefore, no TCS shall be applicable on expenditure through international credit card while being overseas till further order.\nFAQ 2: Whether the threshold of Rs 7 lakh, for TCS to become applicable on LRS, applies separately for various purposes like education, health treatment and others? For example, if remittance of Rs 7 lakh under LRS is made in a financial year for education purpose and other remittances in the same financial year of Rs 7 lakh is made for medical treatment and Rs 7 lakh for other purposes, whether the exemption limit of Rs 7 lakh shall be given to each of the three separately?\nAns. 2: It is clarified that the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for LRS is combined threshold for applicability of the TCS on LRS irrespective of the purpose of the remittance. This is clear from the first proviso to sub-section (1G) of section 206C of the Act. The proviso states that the TCS is not required if the amount or aggregate of the amounts being remitted by a buyer is less than seven lakh rupees in a financial year. The amendment by the Finance Act, 2023 has only restricted it to education and medical treatment purpose. Now, after press release, old position has been restored and the threshold continues to apply for seven lakh rupees in a financial year, irrespective of the purpose.\nThus, in the given example, upto Rs 7 lakh remittance under LRS during a financial year shall not be liable for TCS. However, subsequent Rs 14 lakh remittance under LRS shall be liable for TCS in accordance with the TCS rates applicable for such remittance.\nIn the example, if the remittances under LRS are made in the current financial year at different point of time, TCS rates for the remaining Rs 14 lakh remittances under LRS would depend on the time of remittance as TCS rates changes from 1st October 2023.\nTCS rates would be applicable as under:-\n(a) First Rs 7 lakh remittance under LRS during the financial year 2023-24 for education purpose (or for that matter any purpose) -7 No TCS\n(b) Remittances beyond Rs 7 lakh under LRS during the financial year 2023-24, if on or before 30th September 2023 -7 TCS at 5% (irrespective of the purpose unless it is for education purpose financed by loan from a financial institution when the rate is 5%)\n(c) Remittances beyond Rs 7 lakh under LRS during the financial year 2023-24, if on or after 1st October 2023 -7 TCS at 5% (if it is for education purpose financed by loan from a financial institution), 5% (if it is for education or medical treatment) and 20% (if it is for other purposes)\nFAQ 3: Since there are different TCS rates on LRS for the first six months and next six months of the financial year 2023-24, whether the threshold of Rs 7 lakh, for the TCS to become applicable on LRS, applies separately for each six months?\n Ans. 3: The threshold of Rs 7 lakh, for the TCS to become applicable on LRS, applies for the full financial year. If this threshold has already been exhausted; all subsequent remittances under LRS, whether in the first half or in the second half, would be liable for TCS at applicable rate.\nFAQ 4: Whether the threshold of Rs 7 lakh, for TCS to become applicable on LRS, applies separately for each remittance through different authorised dealers? If not, how will authorised dealer know about the earlier remittances by that remitter through some other authorized dealer?\n Ans 4: It is clarified that the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for LRS is qua remitter and not qua authorised dealer. This is clear from the first proviso to sub-section (1G) of section 206C of the Act. The proviso states that the TCS is not required if the amount or aggregate of amounts being remitted by a buyer is less than seven lakh rupees in a financial year. The threshold continues to apply qua remitter.\nSince the facility to provide real time update of remittance under LRS by remitter is still under development by the RBI, it is clarified that the details of earlier remittances under LRS by the remitter during the financial year may be taken by the authorised dealer through an undertaking at the time of remittance. If the authorised dealer correctly collects the tax at source based on information given in this undertaking, he will not be treated as \u201cassessee in default\u201d. However, for any false information in the undertaking, appropriate action may be taken against the remitter under the Act.\nIt is further clarified that same methodology of taking undertaking from the buyer of overseas tour program package may be followed by the seller of such package.\nFAQ 5: There is threshold of Rs 7 lakh for remittance under LRS for TCS to become applicable while there is another threshold of Rs 7 lakh for purchase of overseas tour program package where reduced rate of 5% TCS applies. Whether these two thresholds apply independently?\n Ans 5: Yes, these two thresholds apply independently. For LRS, the threshold of Rs 7 lakh applies to make TCS applicable. For purchase of overseas tour program package, the threshold of Rs 7 lakh applies to determine the applicable TCS rate as 5% or 20%.\nFAQ 6: A resident individual spends Rs 3 lakh for purchase of overseas tour program package from a foreign tour operator and remits money which is classified under LRS. There is no other remittance under LRS or purchase of overseas tour program during the financial year. Whether TCS is applicable?\nAns 6: In case of purchase of overseas tour program package which is classified under LRS, TCS provision for purchase of overseas tour program package shall apply and not TCS provisions for remittance under LRS.\nSince for purchase of overseas tour program package, the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for applicability of TCS does not apply, TCS is applicable and tax is required to be collected by the seller. In this case the tax shall be required to be collected at 5% since the total amount spent on purchase of overseas tour program package during the financial year is less than Rs 7 lakh. The TCS should be made by the seller.\nFAQ 7: There are different rates for remittance under LRS for medical treatment/education purposes and for other purposes. What is the scope of remittance under LRS for medical treatment/education purposes?\nAns 7: As per the clarification by the RBI, remittance for the purposes of medical treatment shall include,-\n(i) remittance for purchase of tickets of the person to be treated medically overseas (and his attendant) for commuting between India and the overseas destination;\n(ii) his medical expense; and\n(iii) other day to day expenses required for such purpose.\nIt may be noted that code S0304 (under the Purpose Group Name \u201cTravel\u201d), in RBI master direction for LRS, pertains to travel for medical treatment. As per BPM6, A.P. (DIR Series) Circular no 50, dated 11 Feb 2016 this code covers the transactions which are related to health services acquired by residents travelling abroad for medical reasons, which includes medical services, other healthcare, food, accommodation and local transport transactions.\nIn addition, code S1108 (under the Purpose Group Name \u201cPersonal, Cultural & Recreational services\u201d) covers transactions for health services rendered remotely or on\u00ad site (that is no travel by service recipient is involved). This cover services from hospitals, doctors, nurses, paramedical and similar services, etc.\nTCS provision for purpose of medical treatment would apply when remittance is under code S0304 or under code 81108.\nEducation\nRemittance for purpose of education shall include,-\n(i) remittance for purchase of tickets of the person undertaking study overseas for commuting between India and the overseas destination;\n(ii) the tuition and other fees to be paid to educational institute; and\n(iii) other day to day expenses required for undertaking such study.\nIt may be noted that code 80305 (under the Purpose Group Name \u201cTravel\u201d), in RBI master direction for LRS, pertains to travel for education (including fees, hostel expenses, etc). As per BPM6, A.P. (DIR Series) Circular no 50, dated 11 Feb 2016 this code covers education related services such as tuition, food, accommodation, local transport and health services acquired by resident students while residing overseas.\nIn addition, code S1107 (under the Purpose Group Name \u201cPersonal, Cultural & Recreational services\u201d) covers transactions for education (eg fees for correspondence courses abroad) where the person receiving education does not travel overseas.\nTCS provision for purpose of education would apply when remittance is under code S0305 or under S1107.\nFAQ 8: Whether purchase of international travel ticket or hotel accommodation on standalone basis is purchase of overseas tour program package?\n Ans 8: The term \u2018overseas tour program package\u2019 is defined as to mean any tour package which offers visit to a country or countries or territory or territories outside India and includes expenses for travel or hotel stay or boarding or lodging or any other expenditure of similar nature or in relation thereto.\nIt is clarified that purchase of only international travel ticket or purchase of only hotel accommodation, by in itself is not covered within the definition of \u2018overseas tour program package\u2019. To qualify as \u2018overseas tour program package\u2019, the package should include at least two of the followings:-\n(i) international travel ticket,\n(ii) hotel accommodation (with or without food)/boarding/lodging,\n(iii) any other expenditure of similar nature or in relation thereto.\n(Jivitesh Anand)\nUndersecretary to Government of India\n30 June 2023\nCopy to:\n(i) PS to FM/ OSD to FM/ PS to MoS(F)/ OSD to MoS(F)\n(ii) PPS to Secretary (Revenue)\n(iii) Chairman, CBDT & All Members, CBDT\n(iv) All Pr.

These were to take effect from 1st July 2023. It was also announced in March that credit card payments would be brought under the LRS. Numerous comments and suggestions were received which have been carefully considered.\n(ii) In response to the comments and suggestions it has been decided to make suitable changes. Firstly, it has been decided that there will be no change in the rate of TCS for all purposes under LRS and for overseas travel tour packages, regardless of mode of payment, for amounts up to Rs. 7 lakh per individual per annum. It has also been decided to give more time for the implementation of the revised TCS rates and for inclusion of credit card payments in LRS.

These amendments, inter alia, increased the rate of TCS from 5% to 20% for remittance under LRS as well as for purchase of overseas tour program package and removed the threshold of Rs 7 lakh for triggering TCS on LRS. These two changes were not applicable when the remittance is for education or medical These amendments were to take effect from 1st July 2023.\n(v) The Government had notified Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) (Amendment) Rules, 2023 vide an e-gazette notification dated 16th May 2023 to remove the differential treatment for credit cards vis a vis other modes of drawal of foreign exchange under LRS.\n(vi) After discussions with various stakeholders, and taking into account comments and suggestions received, the following decisions have been taken:\n(a) To give adequate time to Banks and Card networks to put in place requisite IT based solutions, the Government has decided to postpone the implementation of its 16th May 2023 e- gazette notification.

"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an era of globalized economies, many corporations find themselves dealing with foreign direct investments (FDI) and overseas investments. Ensuring compliance with Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) and its directives becomes crucial to these operations. One such requirement is the annual return on Foreign Liabilities and Assets (FLA), necessitated from all companies involved in FDI and/or overseas investments in any given year. This return, due by July 15th of the following year, is a fundamental step towards maintaining FEMA compliance.\nFLA returns are crucial when a company accepts foreign direct investment (FDI) or when it engages in overseas investments. Such investments might include joint ventures or wholly-owned subsidiaries, also known as Overseas Direct Investments (ODI). The return must include comprehensive details about these investments and must be submitted online to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on their portal (https://flair.rbi.org.in).\nWho Should Submit FLA Returns?\nThe FLA is expected from entities that have received FDI and/or made overseas investments in any of the previous years, including the current one. These entities hold foreign assets or liabilities in their balance sheets and include:\n\nCompanies incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013\nInsurance companies complying with the Insurance Act, 1938\nBanking companies\nCompanies involved in electricity supply or generation\nCompanies under any special act presently in force\nCertain corporates specified by the Central Government\nLimited Liability Partnerships (LLP) registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008\nOther entities such as SEBI-registered Alternative Funds (AIFs), Partnership Firms, and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)\n\n\nThe FLA Filing Procedure\nEntities eligible for FLA returns must file these via an excel sheet before July 15th each year, accounting for FDI or ODI from the previous and current year. The return should be filed by an authorized individual such as the Company Secretary, Director, or Chief Financial Officer, and should comply with the company\u2019s audited accounts. In cases where the accounts haven\u2019t been audited by July 15th, companies should submit provisional data, revising it with audited financial details by September 30th of the same year.\nLate Submissions and Exemptions\nMissing the due date (July 15th every year) for the return submission is considered a violation of FEMA, attracting a late submission fee of Rs. 7500. However, if an entity hasn\u2019t received any FDI or made overseas investments in any given year, including the current one, and doesn\u2019t hold any outstanding inward or outward FDI or ODI at the end of March of that financial year, they are exempt from submitting the FLA return. Moreover, submitting balance sheets or profit and loss accounts along with the FLA return isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn an increasingly interconnected business world, navigating regulations like FEMA and its compliance requirements is crucial. Timely and accurate submission of FLA returns is a key aspect of this. While the process may seem daunting, understanding who is required to submit these returns, the procedure, and timelines can simplify the process, ensuring compliance and aiding in seamless overseas investment operations.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/external-commercial-borrowings-regulations-eligibility-reporting.html", "title": "External Commercial Borrowings: Regulations, Eligibility and Reporting", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Commercial Borrowings (ECB) provide eligible entities with an avenue to raise funds from outside India. In this article, we explore the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018, and the Master Direction No. 5 on \u2018External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credits, and Structured Obligations.\u2019 We examine the eligibility criteria for borrowers and the purposes for which ECB proceeds can be utilized. Additionally, we delve into the maturity period, borrowing limits, and the procedure and reporting requirements associated with ECB.\nI. Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018 (Amended up to February 27, 2019):\nUnder Point No. 4(B) \u2013 Borrowing by persons other than Authorised Dealers, it is mentioned that \u2018Eligible resident entities may raise ECB from outside India in accordance with the provisions contained in Schedule I.\u2019 Schedule I is the summary and Master Direction given below caters to all the aspects of External Commercial Borrowings.\nECB can be raised in Foreign Convertible Currency as well as in Indian Rupees.\nII. Master Direction No. 5 on \u2018External Commercial Borrowings, Trade Credits and Structured Obligations\u2019:\nEligibility for Borrower:\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds bya) All entities eligible to raise Foreign Direct Investment\nb) Port Trusts, Units in SEZ, SIDBI and EXIM Bank\nc) For Indian rupee denominated ECB, additionally registered entities in micro-finance activities can also raise them.\nPurpose:\nECB proceeds cannot be utilised for:\na) Real estate activities.\nb) Investment in capital market.\nc) Equity investment.\nd) Working capital purposes, except in case of ECB mentioned at v(b) and v(c) under point 2.1 ECB framework.\n\n\ne) General corporate purposes, except in case of ECB mentioned at v(b) and v(c) under point 2.1 ECB framework.\nf) Repayment of Rupee loans, except in case of ECB mentioned at v(d) and v(e) under point 2.1 ECB framework.\ng) On-lending to entities for the above activities, except in case of ECB raised by NBFCs as given at v(c), v(d) and v(e) under point 2.1 ECB framework.\nMaturity & Limit:\na) Minimum Average Maturity Period is 3 years. However, for some specified categories mentioned under point 2.1 ECB Framework, the period varies from 1 year to 10 years.\nb) All eligible borrowers can raise ECB up to USD 750 million or equivalent per financial year under Automatic Route. For higher amount, Approval Route can be opted.\u00a0\nProcedure & Reporting:\na) They can be easily raised through Automatic Route. However, for Approval Route, borrowers have to approach RBI with an application in Form ECB.\nb) Withdrawal from loan account can be done only after obtaining Loan Registration Number from bank. The same be applied through AD Category I bank.\nc) Monthly reporting through Form ECB 2 within seven working days of close of month. Also, any changes are also required to be reported in this form.\nConclusion: External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) serve as a vital source of funding for eligible entities. The regulations and guidelines outlined in the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018, and the Master Direction No. 5 provide a framework for raising ECB. Understanding the eligibility criteria, permissible purposes, maturity period, borrowing limits, and reporting requirements is essential for entities considering ECB.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/rbi-investment-portfolio-guidelines-2023-key-updates.html", "title": "RBI Investment Portfolio Guidelines 2023: Key Updates", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently issued updated guidelines regarding the investment portfolios of commercial banks.

Like any loan proposal, investments undergo the same credit risk analysis. Banks have been advised to have even their own credit analysis and credit rating even in respect of rated issues and pure reliance on external rating of agencies. This is obvious in view of massive failure of banks depending upon the credit rating agencies for housing bubble, failure of countries which fancy a better rating system by historical reasons. Recent financial world including India is a witness to frequent failure of financial institutions.\n6. Let\u2019s learn the categorization of investments.\nThe banks shall classify their entire investment portfolio as Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS), Fair value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) .Obviously, the categorization of investment is done before and at the time of acquisition and the decision shall be definitely documented.\nHow shall these investments be presented in their Balance Sheet?\nIt shall be as under:\ni. Government securities\nii. Other approved securities\niii. Shares\niv. Debentures & Bonds\nv. Subsidiaries and / or joint ventures\nvi. Others (to be specified)\nTime to learn the basics of HTM, AFS, and HFT.\nHTM\nTo quote from the text:\ni. The security is acquired with the intention and objective of holding it to maturity, i.e., the financial assets are held with an objective to collect the contractual cash flows; and\nii. the contractual terms of the security give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal7and interest on principal outstanding (\u2018SPPI criterion\u2019) on specified dates.\nMore details can be obtained from the direct communication.\nAFS\nWhat about AFS?\ni. \u201cThe security is acquired with an objective that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling securities; and\nii. the contractual terms of the security meet the \u2018SPPI criterion\u2019 as given in paragraph 6.1(a)(ii) above.\nProvided that on initial recognition, a bank may make an irrevocable election to classify an equity instrument that is not held with the objective of trading (i.e., not held for any of the purposes listed in paragraph 4 of Annex I) under AFS.\n(b) AFS securities shall inter-alia include debt securities held for asset liability management (ALM) purposes that meet the SPPI criterion where the bank\u2019s intent is flexible with respect to holding to maturity or selling before maturity.\u201d\nWhat are FVTPL and can we know their names?\nSecurities that fail to fall under HTM or SFS find their place under this category. It can be mentioned as under:\ni. \u201cEquity shares, other than (a) equity shares of subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures and (b) equity shares where, at initial recognition, the irrevocable option to classify at AFS has been exercised.\nii. Investments in Mutual Funds, Alternative Investment Funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts, Infrastructure Investment Trusts, etc.\niii. Investment in securitisation notes which represent the equity tranche of a securitisation transaction. Investments in senior and other subordinate tranches shall need to be reviewed for their compliance with SPPI criterion explained in clause 6.1(c) above.\niv. Bonds, debentures, etc. where the payment is linked to the movement in a particular index such as an equity index rather than an interest rate benchmark.\u201d\nIt is essential to learn how initially these securities are recognized for value?\nAll investments are measured at fair value which turns out to be acquisition cost.\nChapter 4 under initial recognition, under para 8-10 details with government securities, any day 1 gains/losses for the purpose of Profit and loss account.\nWhat about subsequent measurement which may take place depending upon the financial position of the bank or policy changes on investment.\n HTM\n(a) Securities held in HTM shall be carried at cost and shall not be marked to market (MTM) after initial recognition. However, they shall be subject to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms as specified in Chapter X of these Directions.\nAFS\nAs per its name, these are available for sale. Then what?\nThe securities held in AFS shall be fair valued at least on a quarterly basis, if not more frequently. Any discount or premium on the acquisition of debt securities under AFS shall be amortised over the remaining life of the instrument. The amortised amount shall be reflected in the financial statements under item II \u2018Income on Investments\u2019 of Schedule 13: \u2018Interest Earned\u2019 with a contra in Schedule 8:\u2019Investments\u2019..\nHowever, the net appreciation or depreciation11 shall be directly credited or debited to a reserve named AFS-Reserve without routing through the Profit & Loss Account.\nThe securities held in FVTPL shall be fair valued and the net gain or loss arising on such valuation shall be directly credited or debited to the Profit and Loss Account. Securities that are classified under the HFT sub-category within FVTPL shall be fair valued on a daily basis, whereas other securities in FVTPL shall be fair valued at least on a quarterly, if not on a more frequent basis.\nAccounting adjustments?\n(b) Any discount or premium on the acquisition of debt12 securities under FVTPL shall be amortised over the remaining life of the instrument.

Clear examples with actual declaration of treatment can be summarized as under.\nFrom to accounting treatment\nHTM \u2013 AFS: Fair value on reclassification date shall be revised carrying value. Gain or loss to be under AFS Reserve.\nHTM \u2013 FVTPL: Fair value on reclassification date shall be the carrying value. Gain or loss to be duly accounted in the Profit and Loss Account under Item (III): \u2018Profit on revaluation of investments\u2019 under Schedule 14: \u2018Other Income\u2019.\nAFS To HTM: The investments to be reclassified at its fair value. An interesting treatment. Of account. However, the cumulative gain/loss previously recognised in the AFS-Reserve shall be withdrawn therefrom and adjusted against the fair value of the investments at the reclassification date to arrive at the revised carrying value. Thus, the revised carrying value shall be the same as if the bank had classified the investment in HTM ab initio itself.\nSimilar transfer of AFS To FVTPL or FVTPL To HTM/AFS are given in the master circular. One can refer for detailed analysis.\nFurther information on fair value calculation.\n\nQuoted Securities\nThe fair value for the quoted securities shall be the prices declared by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd.

These regulations strictly govern such financial dealings to ensure compliance with the law. Any violation of these regulations could result in penalties which may go up to three times the amount involved in the violation. In this article, I address frequently asked questions (FAQs) regarding the rules and restrictions governing borrowing and lending between residents and non-residents.\nQ.1 Can an NRI/OCI borrow in INR from a resident Indian?\nAns. An Indian resident individual is allowed to lend money in INR to an NRI/OCI relative. \u201cRelative\u201d in this context refers to the spouse, parents, son, son\u2019s wife, daughter, daughter\u2019s husband, brother, and sister of the resident. However, it is important to note that residents cannot lend money to NRIs/OCIs who are not relatives, as this would be considered a violation of FEMA regulations.\nQ.2 Can the person who is not an NRI/OCI borrow money from resident?\nAns. According to FEMA regulations, only NRIs/OCIs are allowed to borrow money from residents. As a result, individuals who are not NRIs/OCIs are not eligible to borrow money from residents.\n\n\nQ.3 What is the mode of lending money to NRI/OCI relative?\nAns. The permissible mode of lending money to an NRI/OCI relative is through a crossed cheque or electronic transfer. Cash transactions are not allowed. The loan amount should be credited to the NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) account of the NRI/OCI relative.\nQ.4 What is the maximum amount of loan?\nAns. The maximum amount of the loan that can be given to an NRI/OCI relative should fall within the overall limit under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of USD 250,000 per financial year available for a resident individual. It is essential for the lender to ensure that the loan amount along with other permissible remittance under LRS remains within the LRS limit during the financial year.\n\nQ.5 Can he collect interest on this loan given to NRI/OCI relative?\nAns. No, interest cannot be charged on the loan given to an NRI/OCI relative. The loan should be interest-free and must have a minimum maturity period of one year. Early repayment of the loan within one year is not allowed.\nQ.6 What are the restrictions for the utilisation of loan by NRI/OCI?\nAns. The NRI/OCI who receives the loan must ensure that it is not utilized for any activities in which investment by NRIs/OCIs is prohibited. Such prohibited activities include engaging in chit fund businesses, nidhi companies, agricultural/plantation activities, and the real estate activities (mere trading in property). The term real estate excludes construction of residential and commercial premises, roads and bridges.\n\n\nQ.7 How can NRI repay the loan to resident?\nAns. The NRI can repay the loan to the resident through the following methods:\n\nInward remittances: Repayment can be made through normal banking channels from a country outside India.\nFrom NRO/NRE/FCNR account: The NRI can use funds from their NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary), NRE (Non-Resident External), or FCNR (Foreign Currency Non-Resident) accounts to repay the loan.\nSale proceeds: The NRI can use the sale proceeds of shares, securities, or immovable properties against which the loan was initially granted.\n\nIt is important to note that the NRI should not explore any other methods or ways to repay the loan and should strictly adhere to these approved repayment channels.\nQ.8 Can the NRI/OCI repatriate the loan outside India?\nAns. The NRI/OCI is not permitted to repatriate the borrowed money outside India. The loan amount must be utilized only within India and cannot be taken outside the country.\nQ.9 Can a resident lend money to NRI/OCI relative in foreign currency by remitting money outside India under LRS?\nAns. No, a resident individual cannot lend money in foreign currency to any NRI/OCI, whether they are relatives or not, by remitting money outside India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). The lending should be done only in Indian Rupees and not in foreign currency.\nBorrowing from NRI/OCI by the residents:\nQ.10 Can a resident borrow money from NRI/OCI relatives?\nAns. According to the current regulations, an individual resident in India may be allowed to borrow money from NRI/OCI relatives, subject to the terms and conditions specified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, as of now, RBI has not prescribed any specific terms and conditions for such borrowing transactions. Due to the absence of clear guidelines, it becomes challenging to determine definitively whether borrowing from NRI/OCI relatives is permissible or not.\nQ.11 Can a resident borrow money from NRI/OCI who is not a relative to such resident?\nAns. A resident individual cannot borrow money from NRI/OCI who is not a relative to them. The borrowing is only permissible from NRI/OCI relatives as defined under the applicable regulations. Transactions of borrowing from non-relatives would be considered a violation of FEMA regulations and are not allowed.\nQ.12 Can a resident borrow money from a person who is not a NRI/OCI?\nAns. A resident individual cannot borrow money from a person who is not an NRI/OCI. FEMA regulations restrict borrowing from non-resident individuals who are not classified as NRIs/OCIs. Therefore, borrowing from such individuals is not permitted under the current rules.\nQ.13 Can a business entity in India borrow money from NRI/OCI?\nAns. Business entities in India, such as partnership firms and LLPs, are not allowed to borrow money from NRIs/OCIs. However, an Indian company can borrow money from NRI/OCI individuals who are foreign equity holders, meaning those who hold a direct equity stake of at least 25% in the company. The company cannot borrow money from any other NRIs/OCIs who do not meet these criteria of being foreign equity holders.\nContinuation of loan in the event of change in the residential status:\nQ.15 In case a loan was granted by a resident individual to another resident individual and the lender subsequently becomes a non-resident, how he can repay the loan?\nAns. If a loan was initially granted by a resident individual to another resident individual, and later, the lender becomes a non-resident, the repayment of the loan by the resident borrower should be made by crediting the amount to the Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) account of the non-resident lender. This allows for a seamless and compliant repayment process, ensuring that the loan is settled in accordance with the relevant regulations.\nConclusion: In conclusion, borrowing and lending transactions between residents and non-residents are subject to strict regulations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). It is essential for individuals and business entities to be well-informed about the specific provisions and restrictions outlined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure compliance with the law. Any violation of these regulations may lead to penalties, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the prescribed rules. Being aware of the FEMA guidelines and seeking professional advice when needed will facilitate smooth and lawful borrowing and lending practices between residents and non-residents, fostering financial integrity and compliance within the framework of India\u2019s foreign exchange regulations.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/companies-obliged-file-foreign-liabilities-assets-fla-returns.html", "title": "Are only companies obliged to file Foreign Liabilities & Assets (FLA) Returns?", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Liabilities and Assets (FLA) Returns serve as a critical component of regulatory compliance in India, primarily focusing on foreign investments and overseas financial transactions. It is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of which entities are legally obligated to file FLA returns with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as well as any exceptions to this requirement.\n1. Companies: Entities that are registered under the Companies Act fall within the ambit of organizations mandated to submit FLA returns. This category primarily encompasses traditional corporations, which are typically involved in various forms of foreign investments.\n2. Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs): In a notable expansion of the scope, Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) registered under the LLP Act are also subject to the FLA filing obligation. This inclusion broadens the spectrum to include non-corporate entities that operate with limited liability status.\n3. Others: The \u201cOthers\u201d category encompasses a diverse array of entities, further underscoring the comprehensive nature of FLA reporting. Entities falling under this category include:\n\nSEBI Registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs): This involves investment funds that operate outside of traditional investment vehicles.\nPartnership Firms (PF): Traditional partnership firms, which may have partnerships with foreign entities, are also part of this category.\nPublic Private Partnerships (PPP): Collaborations between public and private entities, which often involve foreign investments, are covered under FLA filing.\n\nThe rationale behind FLA filing extends beyond the specific classification of entities. The primary objective is to monitor foreign inward and outward investments to safeguard the interests of India\u2019s economy. Therefore, the compliance requirement is not limited to a select group but encompasses a broad spectrum of entities involved in international financial transactions.\nTo fulfill the FLA filing requirement, entities must utilize the FLAIR portal. This portal is specifically designed for Companies, LLPs, Registered Partnership Firms, and other registered entities to establish their dashboards for FLA return submission. For unregistered entities that have Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), the process involves mailing the FLA return and obtaining acknowledgment. This ensures that even entities without formal registration can adhere to FLA reporting norms.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds byIn summary, the mandate to file FLA returns extends beyond traditional companies and includes LLPs and various other entities engaged in foreign investments or overseas financial transactions. This underscores the significance of compliance in accurately tracking and reporting foreign financial activities, ultimately serving the best interests of India\u2019s economy.\nException to FLA Filing: There exists one notable exception to FLA filing. Shares issued by a reporting entity to non-residents on a non-repatriable basis should not be considered as foreign investments. Consequently, entities that have issued such shares exclusively on a non-repatriable basis are exempt from the requirement to submit FLA returns.\nConclusion: A comprehensive understanding of the FLA filing obligation is indispensable for entities engaged in foreign investments or overseas financial transactions within India. While traditional companies and LLPs are part of this regulatory framework, the inclusion of various other entities highlights the necessity of compliance in monitoring foreign financial activities for the benefit of the nation\u2019s economy. Additionally, the exception related to non-repatriable shares provides clarity on scenarios where FLA filing may not be applicable, ensuring a well-defined compliance framework.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/understanding-fla-return-filing-requirements-penalties-guidelines.html", "title": "Understanding FLA Return: Filing Requirements, Penalties and Guidelines", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annual return on Foreign Liabilities and Assets (FLA) is a crucial requirement for entities that have received foreign direct investment (FDI) or made investments abroad. These entities, including companies under the Companies Act, 2013, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, and others such as SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Partnership Firms, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), etc., are mandated to submit the FLA return under FEMA 1999. The submission should be based on audited or unaudited accounts of the entity, and it must be completed by July 15 every year.\nFailing to file the FLA return by the due date will be considered a violation of FEMA, and penalties may be imposed accordingly. It is important for entities to submit the return within the specified deadline. If audited balance sheets are not available, entities may fill the return using provisional or unaudited numbers. Once the audited numbers are ready, they can request a revision of the previously filed return to the RBI. Upon approval by the RBI, the entity can revise the return with audited numbers and resubmit it.\nEntities have the option to submit the FLA return after the due date, but they need to seek approval from the RBI. However, late submission may incur penalties under the penalty clause.\n\nThe FLA return can be submitted through the web-based portal called Foreign Liabilities and Assets Information Reporting (FLAIR) system. The portal\u2019s URL is https://flair.rbi.org.in/fla/faces/pages/login.xhtml. The portal is accessible using various browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.\nTo register on the FLAIR portal, entities need to click on \u201cRegistration for New Entity Users\u201d and fill in the required details in the FLA user registration form. The mentioned documents (Verification Letter and Authority Letter) should be uploaded, and the registration can be completed by clicking \u201csubmit.\u201d Upon successful registration, the authorized person will receive a user ID and default password via email. Using these credentials, entities can log in to the FLAIR portal and file the FLA return.\nIt is important to note that the previous excel-based and email-based reporting systems have been replaced by the web-based format for submitting the annual FLA return since June 2019.\nUpon final submission, the system will generate an acknowledgement of the FLA data. No separate email will be sent for this acknowledgment.\nIf an entity needs to revise the FLA return for a previous year, the following steps should be followed:\n1. Login to FLAIR and click on the MENU tab on the left-hand side of the homepage.\n2. Select ONLINE FLA FORM, followed by FLA ONLINE FORM.\n3. Click on \u201cPlease click here to get the approval to fill the revised FLA form for the current year after the due date/previous year.\u201d\n4. Choose the desired year and click \u201cRequest.\u201d\nThe status of the request will be visible in the table available on the screen. After submitting the request to RBI through the FLA portal, entities must wait for at least one working day for approval. The status of the request can be checked in the \u201cMultiple Year Enable Screen\u201d under the menu on the left corner. Once approved by the DSIM, RBI, the entity can revise the FLA return for the selected year.\nThe penalty for non-filing of FLA return is as follows:\nIf the company fails to file the FLA return within the specified time, it will be subject to a penalty. The penalty amount will be three times the sum involved in the contravention. If the sum is not quantifiable, a penalty of Rs. 2,00,000 will be applicable. Additionally, if the contravention continues, a penalty of Rs. 5,000 per day will be imposed on the company.\nIn conclusion, the FAQs on FLA Return provide comprehensive information and clarification for entities with foreign investments. Compliance with RBI regulations regarding the applicability, filing process, and requirements of the FLA Return is essential. By addressing common questions and concerns, these FAQs help businesses fulfill their reporting obligations accurately and within the specified timelines.\nDirect investment, also known as foreign direct investment (FDI), involves investors putting money into businesses operating in other countries. It comprises two components: Equity Capital and Other Capital. Equity Capital includes various types of equities (excluding non-participating preference shares), acquisition of equities in Direct Investment Enterprise, and shares acquired by a DIE in its direct investor company (reverse investment). Other Capital includes receivables, payables, outstanding liabilities or claims out of borrowing, trade credit, financial leasing, share application money, investment in debt securities, and non-participating preference shares.\nThe classes or types that a company may have depend on the range of face values for the company\u2019s shares. For example, if a company has shares with face values of INR 10 and INR 20, the number \u201c2\u201d should be indicated as the classes of shares. Similarly, if the company has partially paid-up shares, \u201c2\u201d should be inserted against the classes of shares.\nParticipating Preference Shares refer to shares that have the right to receive dividends out of surplus profit after paying the dividend. These shares also have the right to share in case of winding up, entitling them to a portion of the surplus assets remaining after repaying the entire capital.\n****\nDisclaimer :This article provides general information existing at the time of preparation and we take no responsibility to update it with the subsequent changes in the law.

The judgement holds a crucial importance as there had been many instances of misuse of the master directions by banks in the recent past. The judgement also came as a stop to several ongoing contentions throughout the country in various courts challenging the constitutionality and validity of The Master Directions on the grounds of violation of the principle of natural justice, here particularly, the rule of Audi alteram partem, and violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14,19 and 21 of the constitution.\nSince 2016, the RBI has begun giving broad regulatory directives called master directions.\u00a0 The directions released combine guidance on rules and regulations established by The Reserve Bank of India under numerous Acts, including those governing banking matters and foreign exchange transactions. The court held that the present case is not based on the competency of RBI to issue these Master Directions, as it is well within its authority to determine and frame economic measures in the public interest to ensure the proper management of banking companies. Instead, the case delves into whether such measures comport with established principles and due process of law or not.\nMaster Directions vis-a-vis the Right to be Heard\nIn July 2016, RBI came out with Master Circulation on Frauds-classification and reporting under section 35A of The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, to curb the growing cases of frauds and protect the interest of depositors. \u00a0The Master Directions on Frauds does not provide for whether or not the borrower is entitled to an opportunity of being heard after the receipt of forensic audit report and before deciding whether the borrower\u2019s account should be classified as fraud. While the directions specifically mentions that an opportunity of hearing be provided to third party who is involved in the commission of fraudulent activity.[2].\nThe appellants in the given case contested that while deciding on the status of the account of borrower, Audi alteram partem ought to be read into the Master Directions on Frauds, as the principle can be read into a statue or a notification where it is silent on granting an opportunity of a hearing to a party whose rights and interests are likely to be affected by the orders that may be passed. Also, the discrimination between the borrowers and third parties could also be viewed as arbitrary and hence violative of Article 14 of the constitution. Further, the participation of the borrower during the preparation of the forensic audit report does not serve to the principle of natural justice in its substance.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/While on the other hand the RBI and other lenders bank contended that the master direction on fraud impliedly exclude the right to be heard, therefore the clauses must be interpreted in light of their purpose and objective, that is, timely detection and dissemination of information and reporting about the fraud. Therefore, the principles of natural justice could be excluded in cases where there is a requirement of promptitude or exigent action. Further they argued that the directions are not arbitrary as ultimate decision on fraud is rendered by a competent court of law thereby giving the parties the opportunity to present their cause.\nThe court acknowledged that the principles of natural justice have a universal application and constitute an important facet of procedural propriety envisaged under Article 14, the same was also upheld by a Constitution Bench in the case of Tulsiram Patel[3]. Further it relied on its decision in Swadeshi Cotton Mills v Union of India[4] that the court must lean in favor of reading in the principles of natural justice when faced with a regulatory silence. Any exclusion must be confined to the narrowest possible limits. The application of the requirement of a prior hearing could be excluded only in situations where importing it would have the effect of paralyzing the entire process. Here the court held that giving an opportunity of a hearing will not obstruct the taking of prompt action under the Master Directions on Frauds. Though they made it clear that the borrowers and the third party stands on a different footing, hence the Master Directions on Frauds per say does not suffer from arbitrariness on the contended grounds.\nMaster Directions vis-a-vis the Right to Reputation\nThe other major point of contention before the bench was whether the classification of a borrower\u2019s account as fraudulent under the Master Directions on Frauds entails civil consequences on borrowers.\n\nThe appellants here highlighted Clause 8.12.1 of the master directions, which, barres the borrower, including the promoters and directors of the company from availing credit from financial markets and credit markets including banks for a period of five or more years. On the other hand, RBI argued that the consequences are in public interest therefore are not unjustified. The court ruled that labelling an account as fraudulent has further legal and penal repercussions against the borrowers, which can in many cases result in the borrowers\u2019 civil death by harming their right to reputation in addition to reporting the crime to investigating authorities. It further related the classification to blacklisting the borrowers for not being trustworthy enough to avail credits by the banks. The bench stated that the court in such situation, has consistently held that an opportunity of hearing ought to be provided before a person is blacklisted and hence the similar needs to be followed in the given case as well.\nThe appellants contended that the principles laid by the court for the purpose of declaring a borrower as a willful defaulter in State Bank of India v Jah Developers[5] , that dealt with requirement of natural justice for the purposes of declaring a borrower as a willful defaulter would squarely be applicable to the given case. While the RBI and other lender banks contended that the process for classification of a borrower as a willful defaulter under the Master Circular on Willful Defaulters significantly differs from the process of classification of an account as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds therefore the decision of the court in Jah Developers[6] will not be applicable to the facts of the case in hand.\nThe court concurred on the fact that the procedures are different in the two cases though it simultaneously observed, that the consequences they will face are similar or even harsher for the latter, as by virtue of Clause 8.12.1 of the Master Directions on Frauds, the penal provisions applicable to willful defaulters also apply to fraudulent borrowers. Hence it concluded that the observations in Jah Developers[7] on the effect of declaring a borrower as wilful defaulter will be squarely applicable to the present case.\nConclusion and Observations\n\n\nThe judgement comes as a great relief for borrowers from different segments of the economy, be it big business conglomerates, MSME\u2019s or other flourishing start-ups. It is a good kick for such businesses to conduct their operations, which unavoidably includes availing credits as a crucial part of their finance raising processes, without the fear of exploitation at the hand of lenders. The judgement is a step towards creating a level playing field in the finance system between the creditors and debtors, by checking on the powers of the former and ensuring fairness for the latter. Overall, it is a welcomed judgement by the business class of the country and a positive approach towards promoting the ease of doing business in India. It heads towards normalizing the process of availing loans for the running of business, breaking the stereotype of the creditors being in the influential positions by simply reiterating the same age-old principles of natural justice into the lines of master directions that are issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\n[1] State Bank of India v Rajesh Agarwal [2023] SCC OnLine 342 (SC).\n[2] Clause 8.12.5 of the Master Directions on Frauds.\n[3] Union of India v Tulsiram Patel [1985] 3 SCC 398.\n[4] Swadeshi Cotton Mills v Union of India [1981] 1 SCC 664.\n[5] State Bank of India v Jah Developers [2019] 6 SCC 787.\n[6] Ibid.\n[7] Ibid.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/external-commercial-borrowings-countries-sharing-land-border-countries.html", "title": "External Commercial Borrowings from countries sharing land border with countries", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia has been rapidly emerging as one of the preferred countries for foreign Investment.

However, underwriting by foreign branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks for issuances by Indian banks will not be allowed.\nEligibility for ECB:\nAll entities eligible[2] \u00a0to receive Foreign Direct Investment shall be considered eligible Borrowers for the purpose of availing Foreign Currency denominated ECB including:\ni. Port Trusts;\nii. Units in SEZ;\niii. SIDBI; and\niv. EXIM Bank of India.\nFurther all entities eligible to avail foreign currency denominated ECB shall be eligible for availing INR denominated ECB.\nFED Master Direction No.5/2018-19 on External Commercial Borrowings provide that all entities eligible to receive FDI shall be eligible to receive FCY denominated ECB and further that all entities eligible to raise FCY denominated ECBs shall be eligible to receive INR denominated ECB. The Criteria for eligibility considers whether the entity is eligible to receive FDI or not, however it does not clarify whether FDI shall be allowed under automatic or approval route.\nThis could also mean that entities not prohibited to receive FDI shall be eligible to raise funds by way of ECB.\nPresent Situation for Investment by land border sharing countries:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India through Authorised Dealer Banks are considering the applications for ECB from countries sharing land border with India (provided the lenders are from FATF and IOSCO countries).\nWhile the equity participation by person resident or situated in land border sharing countries is under the tight scrutiny of the relevant ministries, the Reserve Bank of India seems to be lenient for considering applications for External Commercial Borrowing. One of the reasons for allowing ECB from land border sharing countries is non transfer of ownership thus preventing the opportunistic takeovers and acquisition of the Indian Companies. Further ECB shall also allow the Indian Companies to meet the urgent funding requirements without providing ownership to entities/ investors situated in countries sharing land border with India.\nThe time taken by Reserve Bank of India for considering applications for ECB under automatic route is generally much lesser then the time taken for receiving approval from the ministry for obtaining approval for equity investment thus encouraging the investor and investee to choose the ECB route to meet the funding requirements on urgent and timely basis.\nECB from equity holder shall be allowed in case the lender holders 25% of the direct equity or 51% of the indirect equity of the borrower. Thus, while ECB could be an option for the existing entities having prescribed equity investment by the non residents from countries sharing land border with India, new entrants/ investors will have to recourse to the government approval route only.\nThe object of the ministry seems to monitor the existing and new equity investments from the countries sharing land border with India but not to restrict the fundings for existing Companies carrying of legitimate business. Also the funds availed by way of ECB, Interest payments, parking of the proceeds and the utilisation is closely monitored by the AD bank/ RBI through monthly returns to be submitted by the borrower entity.\n\n\n[1] Source: Press information by Ministry of Commerce and Industry\n[2] Entities eligible to receive FDI: Indian Companies, LLP are considered to be eligible entities to receive FDI as per Schedule I of Foreign Exchange Management (Non Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019.Foreign Investment in Investment Vehicle shall be as per Schedule VIII of the Rules.

"https://taxguru.in/rbi/repo-rates-india-significance-effects-current-outlook.html", "title": "Repo Rates in India: Significance, Effects and Current Outlook", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on June 8th 2023, said the repo rate will be unchanged at 6.5 per cent. This is for the second time that the central bank has kept the basic rate unchanged.\nThe repo rate in India holds significant importance in the country\u2019s monetary policy framework. Here are some key points regarding the significance, effects, and current outlook of the repo\u00a0rate\u00a0in\u00a0India.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) employs various tools to maintain price stability and ensure the efficient functioning of the economy. Among these tools, repo rates and reverse repo rates are fundamental in nature. By adjusting these rates, the RBI strives to strike a balance by controlling inflationary pressures and promoting economic activity. It is crucial for businesses and individuals to be aware of these rates as they have a far-reaching impact on interest rates, credit availability and consumption\nRepo rate and its impact\nThe repo rate, short for Repurchasing Option rate, refers to the rate at which the RBI lends funds to commercial banks to address temporary liquidity shortages. When banks require short-term funds, they can borrow from the RBI by providing eligible securities such as treasury bills as collateral. The repo rate represents the interest charged on these borrowings. By increasing the repo rate, the RBI makes borrowings more expensive for banks, leading to reduced borrowing and lending activities. This, in turn, decreases the money supply in the market, curbing inflationary pressures. Conversely, a decrease in the repo rate incentivizes banks to borrow more from the RBI, making borrowing costs more affordable for businesses and individuals. This stimulates lending, investments, and overall economic growth.\nReverse repo rate and its impact\n\n\nThe reverse repo rate, as the name suggests, is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks. By offering government securities as collateral, the RBI absorbs excess liquidity from the banking system. An increase in the reverse repo rate encourages banks to park their surplus funds with the RBI, earning interest on these investments. Consequently, the amount of money available for lending decreases, leading to tightened money supply in the economy. Conversely, a decrease in the reverse repo rate prompts banks to lend more to the economy, boosting the money supply and stimulating economic activity.\nCurrent scenario and its impact on individuals and businesses\nIn the most recent bi-monthly meeting held on June 8th 2023, the RBI\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee decided to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% and retained the FY24 GDP growth forecast at 6.5%. Changes in repo rates directly affect individuals, particularly those with loans and deposits. When the repo rate increases, banks pass on the higher rates to borrowers, resulting in\nincreased interest rates. Home loan borrowers, who often have floating interest rates, may face higher monthly installments or extended loan tenure. This, in turn, can lead to reduced financing-based consumption, such as purchases of flats, consumer durables, and vehicles. On the positive side, an increase in the repo rate leads to higher deposit rates, benefiting senior citizens and others who rely on income from fixed deposits. Conversely, when the repo rate decreases, loans become cheaper for individuals with variable interest rates. However, deposit interest rates may fall in such scenarios.\nFuture outlook and considerations\nExperts suggest that the RBI will likely maintain the repo rate unchanged in 2023, with any rate cuts dependent on inflationary pressures and the monsoon season. For senior citizens, the current period presents an opportune time to secure high-interest-bearing fixed deposits. Similarly, for those planning to take home loans, opting for floating interest rate loans now might be advantageous, as interest rates are expected to remain stable or potentially decrease in the near future.\nUnderstanding repo rates and reverse repo rates is essential for individuals and businesses to comprehend the implications on interest rates, credit availability, investments, and overall economic conditions. By closely monitoring these rates and their potential changes, individuals can make informed financial decisions and adapt to the prevailing market conditions.\n*****\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This article provides general information existing at the time of preparation and we take no responsibility to update it with the subsequent changes in the law.

Introduction: Understanding FCGPR\nForeign Contribution General Purpose Remittance, popularly known by its acronym FCGPR, is a vital concept for companies operating within the Indian economic landscape, which facilitates the seamless receipt of foreign direct investments (FDIs). Falling under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA 1999), FCGPR governs the remittance of foreign funds into India by non-resident entities or individuals, including foreign companies, foreign individuals, and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). This article offers an in-depth understanding of the FCGPR, its applicability, reporting requirements, and penalties for non-compliance, taking into account the most recent legislative updates.\nII. The Scope and Application of FCGPR\nFCGPR applies universally to all Indian companies that receive foreign investment and issue shares or convertible instruments to non-resident investors. In other words, its relevance cuts across both listed and unlisted companies. The act\u2019s essence lies in its facilitation of the smooth inflow of foreign capital, which not only boosts the financial health of companies but also catalyzes economic growth at large.\nIII. The Vital Role of Authorized Dealer Banks in FCGPR\nIn the context of FCGPR, authorized dealer banks play a crucial role. These banks, appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), are entrusted with managing foreign exchange transactions. All foreign investment under FCGPR must be channeled through an authorized dealer bank. This safeguard ensures adherence to all regulatory protocols during the inflow of foreign capital.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds byIV. Reporting Requirements Under FCGPR: A Closer Look\nCompanies receiving foreign investment under FCGPR are subject to strict reporting protocols. These companies are obliged to report the transaction to the RBI within a specified timeline, ensuring transparency and compliance. This reporting is executed through online filing on the RBI\u2019s Foreign Investment Reporting and Management System (FIRMS) portal.\nFurthermore, post-investment reporting requirements demand that companies submit annual reports and disclose details pertaining to transfer or issue of shares to foreign investors. These requirements mandate companies to keep the RBI informed about all FDI activities and ensure that the inflow of foreign capital is monitored effectively.\nV. Documentation: Ensuring Compliance with FCGPR\nIn the journey to successfully process an FCGPR transaction, companies are required to submit specific documents to the authorized dealer bank for verification. Essential documents typically include a copy of the board resolution, share subscription agreement, foreign inward remittance certificate, and Know Your Customer (KYC) details of the foreign investor. The submission and approval of these documents are preconditions for the completion of an FCGPR transaction.\n\nVI. Complying with Sectoral Caps and Conditions under FCGPR\nAnother key facet of FCGPR transactions is their adherence to sectoral caps and conditions set by the government for foreign investment in specific sectors. As different sectors have varied limits on foreign investment, companies must ensure compliance with these sector-specific rules. By doing so, companies uphold the spirit of the law and contribute towards maintaining a balanced and regulated influx of foreign capital into various sectors.\nVII. Conclusion: Ensuring Compliance with FCGPR\n\n\nIt is critical for companies receiving foreign investment to comply with the provisions of FCGPR and other relevant regulations to avoid penalties and ensure smooth operations. Companies are advised to consult with professionals and refer to the relevant provisions of FEMA 1999, RBI notifications, and circulars for comprehensive and up-to-date information regarding FCGPR and its requirements.\nUnderstanding and adhering to FCGPR is integral to companies that receive foreign investment. By adhering to the provisions of the act, companies not only stay compliant but also contribute to India\u2019s economic growth and stability. As FCGPR continues to evolve in line with changing economic realities, staying updated with the latest legislative changes is of paramount importance for companies and investors alike.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/faqs-external-commercial-borrowing-trade-credits.html", "title": "FAQs on External Commercial Borrowing & Trade Credits", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Updated as on June 26, 2023)\nPART I \u2013 EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL BORROWINGS\nA.

for FLA under FEMA 1999", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Liabilities and Assets (FLA) refers to a specific reporting system under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA 1999) in India. This reporting system is instituted to collate comprehensive data on foreign liabilities (foreign direct investments or FDI) and assets (overseas direct investments or ODI) of Indian companies. The data collected assists in the analysis and understanding of India\u2019s external economic situation.\nPurpose: The primary objective of FLA is to gather exhaustive information about foreign liabilities (FDI into the company) and assets (investments made by the company in foreign entities) of Indian companies. Such a mechanism allows for an accurate understanding of the degree of overseas investment made by Indian entities, and the level of foreign investment attracted by them. This system is implemented under the legal structure of FEMA 1999 and is supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\nApplicability: The FLA reporting requirement is mandatory for all Indian entities that have either attracted FDI or made ODI. This is applicable regardless of the quantum or the proportion of the investment, meaning that even a small amount of foreign investment would necessitate compliance. Importantly, both listed and unlisted companies fall under the purview of this requirement, making it a widespread regulatory norm.\n\nReporting Frequency and Timeline: The FLA reporting mechanism mandates an annual submission of returns. These returns depict the year-end status of the foreign liabilities and assets of the company for the relevant financial year. The timeline for the submission is by July 15th each year, succeeding the end of the financial year on March 31st. For instance, for the financial year that ends on March 31, 2023, the submission of the FLA return should be done by July 15, 2023.\nReporting Process: The FLA return is submitted electronically via an online portal known as FLAIR (Foreign Liabilities and Assets Information Reporting), designed and managed by the RBI. To access and submit the returns, companies need to first register themselves on the FLAIR system.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/Information to be Reported: The FLA return requires detailed information pertaining to the company\u2019s foreign liabilities and assets. This includes:\n\nFDI in the Company: Here, the company must disclose information about equity capital, other capital instruments, and reinvested earnings of the company held by non-resident entities. This helps assess the degree of foreign ownership and influence within the company.\nODI by the Company: This section requires details about investments made by the company in foreign entities. It includes equity capital, other capital instruments, and inter-company borrowings. These details help track the extent and nature of foreign investments by Indian companies.\nOther Liabilities and Assets: This involves a detailed account of trade credits, loans, borrowings, guarantees, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial liabilities and assets. This provides a holistic view of the company\u2019s international financial position beyond equity investments.\n\nPenalties for Non-compliance: Non-compliance with the FLA reporting requirement can lead to penalties under FEMA 1999. If a company fails to submit the FLA return within the stipulated deadline, it may be subject to penalties that could include monetary fines or other punitive measures as per the discretion of the RBI.\nIt\u2019s crucial for Indian companies involved in receiving FDI or making ODI to fully comply with the FLA reporting requirement. In order to ensure accurate and timely submission of the FLA return, companies should closely follow the most recent notifications, circulars, and guidelines issued by the RBI.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/overseas-investment-rules-2022-resident-individuals-indian-entities.html", "title": "Overseas Investment Rules 2022: Resident Individuals and Indian Entities", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: Explore the manner in which resident individuals and Indian entities can engage in overseas investments under the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Rules, 2022.

No, the resident individual is not permitted to make ODI in a foreign entity in which he exercises control and it has one or more subsidiaries.\nSchedule III clearly specifies that \u201cODI in an operating foreign entity not engaged in financial services activity and which does not have subsidiary or step down subsidiary where the resident individual has control in the foreign entity\u201d is allowed. Any deviation from these conditions would lead to noncompliance.\nQ.3 Can a resident individual directly invest in a subsidiary or step-down subsidiary of a foreign entity over which they have control?\nAns. No, a resident individual cannot directly invest in a subsidiary or step-down subsidiary of the foreign entity, even if the parent company isn\u2019t involved in the financial services sector. However, if the resident individual doesn\u2019t have control in the foreign entity with one or more subsidiaries, they are not restricted from investing in the subsidiary or step-down subsidiary.\nQ.4 Is it possible for a resident individual to engage in ODI within a foreign\u00a0entity\u00a0where they do not exercise control, but the entity is involved in financial services activities?\nAns. Even though the resident individual doesn\u2019t exercise control in the foreign entity, yet he is not allowed to make ODI if the entity is engaged in financial services. This remains a restricted scenario.\n\n\nQ.5 Can a resident individual invest in a foreign entity with the intention of ganing control?\nAns.

No, a resident individual can engage in ODI within such subsidiaries, even though he doesn\u2019t exercise control in the foreign entity.

The para 7 of DLG guidelines states clearly irrespective of the invocation of DLG amount the loan accounts shall be classified in accordance to the existing IRAC norms and invoked guarantee amount shall not be set off against the underlying individual loans.\nHowever, any recovery made by the RE on later stage will be share with the DLG provider on the basis of terms set forth under contractual arrangement.\nQ.15 What would be the impact on regulatory capital on loan guaranteed loan portfolio?\nAns. As RBI stated Capital computation, i.e., computation of exposure and application of Credit Risk Mitigation benefits on individual loan assets in the portfolio shall continue to be governed by the extant norms therefore the guaranteed amount would be treated as Guarantee assets and accordingly capital will be maintained on the net amount.\nIn addition to the enclosed questionnaire the DLG recipient make sure about the following things:\n1.

(SPMCIL) and two are owned by the Reserve Bank, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Ltd. (BRBNMPL). The currency presses of SPMCIL are at Nasik (Western India) and Dewas (Central India). The two presses of BRBNMPL are at Mysuru (Southern India) and Salboni (Eastern India).\nCoins are minted in four mints owned by SPMCIL. The mints are located at Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and NOIDA. The coins are issued for circulation only through the Reserve Bank in terms of Section 38 of the RBI Act.\nQ. 4 What is a currency chest?\nAns.\u00a0 To facilitate the distribution of banknotes and rupee coins, the Reserve Bank has authorised select scheduled banks to establish currency chests. These are storehouses where banknotes and rupee coins are stocked on behalf of the Reserve Bank for distribution to bank branches in their area of operation. As on March 31, 2023, there were\u00a02838\u00a0currency chests.\n[The currency chests are expected to distribute banknotes and rupee coins to other bank branches in their area of operation.]\n\n\nQ. 5 What is a small coin depot?\nAns.\u00a0 Some banks are authorised to establish Small Coin Depots to stock and distribute small coins i.e. coins of value below Rupee One to bank branches in their area of operation. As on March 31, 2023,\u00a0there were\u00a02293\u00a0small coin depots.\nQ. 6 What is the role of the Reserve Bank of India in currency management?\nAns.\u00a0 In terms of Section 22 of the Act, Reserve Bank has the sole right to issue banknotes in India. Section 25 states that the design, form and material of bank notes shall be such as may be approved by the Central Government after consideration of the recommendations made by the Central Board of RBI.\nThe Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Central Government and other stake holders, estimates the quantity of banknotes that are likely to be needed denomination-wise in a year and places indents with the various currency printing presses for supply of banknotes. The Reserve Bank in terms of its clean note policy, provides good quality banknotes to the members of public. With this objective in view the banknotes received back from circulation are examined and those fit for circulation are reissued while the others (soiled and mutilated) are destroyed so as to maintain the quality of banknotes in circulation.\nIn respect of coins, the role of RBI is limited to distribution of coins that are supplied by Government of India. The Government of India is responsible for the designing and minting of coins in various denominations as per the Coinage Act, 2011.\nQ. 7 Where can one find information regarding notes/coins supplied by RBI or currently in circulation?\nAns. The information about indent and supply of notes and coins or currency/coins in circulation is available on our website\u00a0www.rbi.org.in, at the following link\u00a0https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualReportMainDisplay.aspx\nQ.8 How does the Reserve Bank distribute currency to the people?\nAns.\u00a0 The Reserve Bank presently manages the currency operations through its 19 Issue Offices located at Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Belapur, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, New Delhi, Patna, Thiruvananthapuram and a currency chest at its Kochi office. Further, a wide network of currency chests maintained and managed by scheduled banks are part of currency management architecture. The Issue Offices receive fresh banknotes from the currency printing presses which in turn send fresh banknote remittances to the currency chests. Direct remittances by the presses to the currency chests also happens.\nThe Reserve Bank offices located at Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and New Delhi (Mint Linked Offices) receive coins from the mints. These offices then send the coins to the other offices of the Reserve Bank who in turn send the same to Currency Chests and Small Coin Depots. The banknotes and rupee coins are stocked at the currency chests and small coins at the small coin depots. The bank branches receive the banknotes and coins from the Currency Chests and Small Coin Depots for further distribution among the public.\nB) Banknotes\nQ.1 What is the meaning of \u201cI promise to pay\u201d clause on the banknotes?\nAns.\u00a0 As per Section 26 of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Bank is liable to pay the value of banknote. This is payable on demand by RBI, being the issuer.\nThe promissory clause printed on the banknotes i.e., \u201cI promise to pay the bearer the sum of Rupees \u2026\u201d denotes the obligation on the part of the Bank towards the holder of the bank note.\nQ.2 Which denomination banknotes are currently in circulation?\nAns.\u00a0 Banknotes in India are currently being issued in the denomination of \u20b910, \u20b920, \u20b950, \u20b9100 \u20b9200, \u20b9500, and \u20b92000. These notes are called banknotes as they are issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The printing of notes in the denominations of \u20b92 and \u20b95 has been discontinued and these denominations have been coinised as the cost of printing and servicing these banknotes was not commensurate with their life. However, such banknotes issued earlier can still be found in circulation and these banknotes continue to be legal tender. \u20b91 notes are issued by the Government of India from time to time and such notes including those issued in the past also continue to be legal tender for transactions.\nQ.3 Can banknotes be issued only in these denominations?\nAns.\u00a0 Not necessarily. In terms of Section 24 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, bank notes shall be of the denominational values of two rupees, five rupees, ten rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees, five thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or of such other denominational values, not exceeding ten thousand rupees, as the Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board, specify in this behalf.\nQ.4 What was the highest denomination note ever printed?\nAns.\u00a0 The highest denomination note ever printed by the Reserve Bank of India was the \u20b910000 note in 1938 which was demonetized in January 1946.

An Inset Letter is an alphabet printed on the Number Panel of the banknote. There can be notes without any inset letter also.\nQ.8 What is non-sequential numbering?\nAns.\u00a0 With a view to enhancing operational efficiency and cost effectiveness in banknote printing, non-sequential numbering was introduced in 2011 consistent with international best practices. Packets of banknotes with non-sequential numbering contain 100 notes which are not sequentially numbered.\nQ.9 What is a \u201cstar series\u201d banknote?\nAns.\u00a0 Fresh banknotes issued by Reserve Bank of India till August 2006 were serially numbered. Each of these banknote bears a distinctive serial number along with a prefix consisting of numerals and letter/s. The banknotes are issued in packets containing 100 pieces.\nThe Bank adopted the \u201cSTAR series\u201d numbering system for replacement of defectively printed banknote in a packet of 100 pieces of serially numbered banknotes. The Star series banknotes are exactly similar to the other banknotes, but have an additional character viz., a *(star) in the number panel in the space between the prefix.\nQ. 10 Who decides on the figure to be printed on a new banknote?\nAns.\u00a0 In terms of Section 25 of the RBI Act, the design, form and material of bank notes shall be such as may be approved by the Central Government after consideration of the recommendations made by Central Board.\nQ. 11 Who decides on the volume and value of banknotes to be printed and on what basis?\nAns.\u00a0 The volume and value of banknotes to be printed in a year depends on various factors such as (i) the expected increase in Notes in Circulation (NIC) to meet the growing needs of the public and (ii) the need for replacing soiled/mutilated notes so as to ensure that only good quality notes are in circulation. The expected increase in NIC is estimated using statistical models which consider macro-economic factors such as expected growth in GDP, inflation, interest rates, growth in non-cash modes of payment etc. The replacement requirement depends on the volume of notes already in circulation and the average life of banknotes. The Reserve Bank estimates the volume and value of notes to be printed in a year based on the above factors as well as feedback received from its own Regional Offices and banks regarding expected demand for cash and finalises the same in consultation with the Government of India and the printing presses.\nQ. 12 Are the banknotes issued by RBI backed by any assets such as gold?\nAns.\u00a0 All banknotes issued by RBI are backed by assets such as gold, Government Securities and Foreign Currency Assets, as defined in Section 33 of RBI Act, 1934.\nC.

Ashoka Pillar Banknotes:\nThe first banknote issued by independent India was the one rupee note issued in 1949. While retaining the same designs the new banknotes were issued with the symbol of Lion Capital of Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath in the watermark window in place of the portrait of King George.\nThe name of the issuer, the denomination and the guarantee clause were printed in Hindi on the new banknotes from the year 1951. The banknotes in the denomination of \u20b91000, \u20b95000 and \u20b910000 were issued in the year 1954. Banknotes in Ashoka Pillar watermark Series, in \u20b910 denomination were issued between 1967 and 1992, \u20b920 denomination in 1972 and 1975, \u20b950 in 1975 and 1981, and \u20b9100 between 1967-1979.

Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series (MGNS) \u2013 Nov 2016\nThe Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series, introduced in the year 2016, highlights the cultural heritage and scientific achievements of the country. The banknotes in the series are more wallet friendly, being of reduced dimensions and hence expected to incur less wear and tear. For the first time, designs for banknotes has been indigenously developed on themes reflecting the diverse history, culture and ethos of the country as also its scientific achievements. The colour scheme is sharp and vivid to make the banknotes distinctive.\nThe first banknote from the new series was introduced on November 8, 2016 and is a new denomination, \u20b92000-with the theme of Mangalyaan. Subsequently, banknotes in this series in denomination of \u20b9500, \u20b9200, \u20b9100, \u20b950, \u20b920 and \u20b910 have also been introduced.\nQ. 2 Which denomination banknotes have been demonetised?\nAns.\u00a0 \u20b9500, \u20b91000 and \u20b910000 banknotes, which were then in circulation were demonetized in January 1946. The higher denomination banknotes in \u20b91000, \u20b95000 and \u20b910000 were reintroduced in the year 1954, and these banknotes (\u20b91000, \u20b95000 and \u20b910000) were again demonetized in January 1978.\nRecently, banknotes in the denomination of \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 issued under the Mahatma Gandhi Series have been withdrawn from circulation with effect from the midnight of November 08, 2016 and are, therefore, no more legal tender.\nAs regards prohibition on holding, transferring or receiving specified bank notes, Section 5 of The Specified Banknotes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017 reads as under:\nOn and from the appointed day, no person shall, knowingly or voluntarily, hold, transfer or receive any specified bank note:\nProvided that nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the holding of specified bank notes\u2014\n(a) by any person\u2014\n(i) up to the expiry of the grace period; or\n(ii) after the expiry of the grace period,\u2014\nA. not more than ten notes in total, irrespective of the denomination; or\nB. not more than twenty-five notes for the purposes of study, research or numismatics;\n(b) by the Reserve Bank or its agencies, or any other person authorised by the Reserve Bank;\n(c) by any person on the direction of a court in relation to any case pending in the court\nDirections and Circulars issued by RBI from time to time in connection with SBNs are available on our website\u00a0www.rbi.org.in\u00a0under Function wise sites>>Issuer of Currency>>All You Wanted Know About SBNs.\u00a0https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3270\nQ.3 What is the status of withdrawal of pre-2005 series banknotes? Where can they be exchanged?\nAns.\u00a0 Reserve Bank of India decided to withdraw from circulation all banknotes issued prior to 2005 as they have fewer security features as compared to banknotes printed after 2005. It is a standard international practice to withdraw old series notes. The RBI has already been withdrawing these banknotes in a routine manner through banks. It is estimated that the volume of such banknotes (pre-2005) in circulation is not significant enough to impact the general public in a big way. The exchange facility for pre-2005 banknotes is available only at the following offices of the Reserve Bank: Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Belapur, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, New Delhi, Patna, Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. This, however, did not imply that banks cannot accept deposits of pre-2005 banknotes for crediting to the customers\u2019 accounts. Please refer to our Press Release no. 2016-17/1565 dated December 19, 2016 in this regard which can be accessed at the following link https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_PressRelease.aspx?prid=38951&fn=2753\nQ.4\u00a0 What happens to the old design banknotes when a new design is introduced?\nAns.\u00a0 Both old and new design notes usually circulate together for a while. The old design notes are then gradually withdrawn from circulation when they become unfit to be re-issued.\nQ.5 What is the need for printing different series of banknotes?\nAns.\u00a0 Central banks the world over change the design of their banknotes and introduce new security features primarily to make counterfeiting difficult and to stay ahead of counterfeiters. India also follows the same policy.\nQ.6\u00a0 What are the Security Features of banknotes in circulation\nAns.\u00a0 The security features in MG Series 2005 and MG (New) Series banknotes are as under:\ni. Security Thread:\u00a0The silver coloured machine-readable security thread in \u20b910, \u20b920 and \u20b950 denomination banknotes is windowed on front side and fully embedded on reverse side.

The colour of these numerals appears green when the banknotes are held flat but would change to blue when the banknotes are held at an angle.\nvi. Fluorescence:\u00a0The number panels of the banknotes are printed in fluorescent ink. The banknotes also have dual coloured optical fibres. Both can be seen when the banknotes are exposed to ultra-violet lamp.\nvii. Latent Image:\u00a0In the banknotes of \u20b920 and above in the MG-2005 Series, the vertical band next to the (right side) Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s portrait contains a latent image, showing the denominational value as the case may be. The value can be seen only when the banknote is held horizontally and light allowed to fall on it; otherwise this feature appears only as a vertical band. In the MG (New) Series banknotes, the latent image exists in denominations \u20b9100 and above.\nviii. Micro letterings:\u00a0This feature appears at different places on the banknotes and can be seen better under a magnifying glass.\nix.

A repo rate hike, while aimed at taming inflation, can have far-reaching implications for borrowers. In this article, we delve into the effects of frequent repo rate hikes and explore strategies to navigate the resulting financial challenges. Join us as we uncover the intricacies of this economic phenomenon and shed light on practical solutions for borrowers.\n1. Rise in Repo Rates: Balancing Inflation and Financial Burden\nWhen central banks decide to increase the repo rate, a complex interplay of economic forces is set into motion. The primary objective behind such rate hikes is to rein in inflation and stabilize the economy. However, for borrowers, these hikes can translate into higher financial commitments.\nIf you have borrowed money with a loan linked to the repo rate, brace yourself for an impact on your Return on Investment (ROI) and Equated Monthly Installments (EMI). The nexus between repo rates and borrowing costs means that an increase in repo rates leads to a direct rise in interest rates, amplifying the cost of borrowing.\n2. Bank Responses and Borrower Dilemmas\nIn response to escalating repo rates, banks typically present borrowers with two alternatives, each with its own implications. The first option involves extending the tenure of the loan while keeping the EMI unchanged. The second option necessitates an increase in the EMI while maintaining the original loan tenure.\n\n\n3. Loan Tenure Capping: A Limiting Factor\nHowever, an intriguing aspect arises when considering the extension of loan tenure. Most loans come with an age-based capping on tenure. For instance, home loans are often granted for a maximum tenure of 20 years, contingent upon the borrower\u2019s age. This constraint stems from the assumption that a borrower\u2019s retirement age is around 60 years. Consequently, banks restrict loan tenures to align with this retirement age parameter.\n4. The Conundrum of Maximum Tenure Loans\nFor those who have already availed the maximum permissible loan tenure, a tightening repo rate environment leaves them with only one recourse: increasing their EMIs. This predicament introduces a host of challenges, as increasing EMIs is not as straightforward as it may seem.\nConsider an illustrative example: Imagine a borrower earning \u20b9100,000 per month and seeking a home loan. Banks typically grant loans based on a percentage of the borrower\u2019s salary, say 70% to 80%, to accommodate EMI payments. The remainder, around 20% to 30%, is reserved for personal expenses. If a borrower finds themselves compelled to raise their EMI to 80% to 85% of their monthly income, precious little remains for other essential expenditures.\n5. Psychological Factors and Borrowing Behavior\nUnderstanding the motivation behind borrowers opting for maximum loans and higher EMIs requires an exploration of human emotions and mindset. Often, individuals channel their life savings into constructing or purchasing a home, leading them to seek out substantial loans. This practice is driven by the sentiment that a home is a once-in-a-lifetime investment, epitomizing the adage \u201cjeevan me Ghar bas ek hi bar banta h.\u201d\nStrategies to Mitigate the Impact of of Increasing Repo Rates\nIn the face of potential financial strain resulting from escalating repo rates, borrowers can adopt several prudent strategies:\n1. Maintain Margin of Safety: Always factor in a margin of safety while procuring loans. This cushion can provide a buffer in case of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n\n2. Loan Transfer: When confronted with financial constraints, consider transferring existing loans to institutions offering longer tenures, extending even up to 30 to 40 years, with maximum age caps set at 75 years. This option can alleviate the immediate burden of higher EMIs.\n3. Market-Aligned Interest Rates: Regularly assess and ensure that the interest rates you are paying align with prevailing market rates. Refinancing at lower rates can lead to substantial savings over time.\nIn conclusion, the intricate dance between repo rates and borrower finances underscores the multifaceted nature of economic decisions. As borrowers navigate the impact of rising repo rates, strategic financial planning and an understanding of market dynamics are invaluable tools to manage the associated challenges effectively. By embracing informed choices, borrowers can proactively shape their financial trajectories despite the fluctuating economic landscape.\n(CA Nitin Bansal, Special Invitee, Committee for Development of International Trade, Services and WTO, ICAI)\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/creation-entity-master-regard-fc-gpr-filing.html", "title": "Creation of Entity Master with Regard to FC-GPR Filing", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to this article aimed at simplifying the process of filing the FC-GPR form for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India.

These transactions include Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), and External Commercial Borrowing (ECB). Lack of expert guidance often leads to non-compliance, resulting in substantial penalties. Drawing on practical experience, this article aims to compile the most prevalent mistakes and provide valuable insights.\n1. The capital accounts transactions under FEMA can be classified as- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), External Commercial Borrowing (ECB). As per FEMA, there are certain compliance guidelines while availing these transactions by the Indian Entities. Often the companies fail to comply with the provisions accurately for lack of expert professional guidance and end up in landing in non- compliance and paying heavy penalties. This article is an endeavour to compile the common errors which the companies/ professionals normally make while handling the transactions under FEMA and is based on practical experience.\n\n2. FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act), is an Act that consolidates and amends laws relating to foreign exchange transactions in India. FEMA regulates two types of transactions (a) Current Account Transactions and (b) Capital Account Transactions.\n3. The Capital Account transactions mainly includes- i. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) ii. Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) iii. External Commercial Borrowing (ECB).\n4. A company/ LLP registered in India can avail FDI, make overseas investment and can borrow foreign funds by complying with the regulations under FEMA and as per RBI Master Directions is issued from time to time. Due care has to be taken while undertaking such transactions. Some of the precautions to be taken and the common mistakes done are discussed in following paras.\n\n\na) A company may take FDI in the form of equity shares, compulsorily convertible preference shares. LLPs are also permitted to avail the FDI. While availing the FDI, the following should be complied with due diligence \u2013\ni. Ensure the activities of your company/ LLP does not fall under prohibited category, gambling, betting, lottery etc. Which are sectors where FDI is not permitted.\nii. Ascertain activities of the company is under automatic route (where no RBI approval is required and only report has to be forwarded) or under approval route (where RBI prior approval is required), Also, ensure sector cap on the foreign holding is applicable or not.\niii. Avail the FDI funds in convertible foreign currency and instruct the foreign remitter not to convert the amount in INR before remittance. This will save considerable time in getting the amount credited in the account.\niv. Ensure the remitter to mention the purpose of the remittance as \u2013 Towards equity/ preference share capital. The purpose would be mentioned in the Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) which is issued by the bank once it receives foreign remittance.\nv. A six pointer KYC of the remitter is required by your bank, before the amount gets credited. This is done through sending a SWIFT message by the receiving bank to the remitting bank, so ensure to ask the foreign investor to inform their bank to reply to the SWIFT message immediately.\nvi. Once the funds is credited in the account, get the six pointer KYC and FIRC from the bank.\nvii. Any amount received in excess, has to be refunded within 60 days of the receipt of the funds, else, after 75 days, an interest becomes payable on the excess amount.\nviii. The reporting of the allotment to the overseas investor has to be in form FC GPR within 30 days of allotment of shares. The reporting is to be done on the FIRMS Portal.\n\n\nix. Ensure entire information as asked are filled up correctly in the form and is reported correctly.\nx. Every year, an annual form called Annual Return on Foreign Liability and Assets (FLA) is required to be filed. Make sure to file FLA every year by 15th July. Any delay in filing will result in contravention of FEMA regulations.\nb) A company may invest overseas to set up a Wholly Owned Subsidiary company or a Joint Venture. One needs to comply with the provisions relating to Overseas Direct Investment-\ni. The amount to be invested by the company should not exceed 400% of its Net worth.\nii. Submit the ODI documents along with other documents to the AD Bank for making the remittance.\niii. Once the remittance is made, make sure to obtain the UIN (Unique Identification Number) issued by RBI.\niv. Make sure to obtain the share certificate / proof of investment for the investment made in the foreign entity and submit the copy to your AD bank within 60 days of remittance.\nv. Submit the Annual Performance Report (APR) to your AD bank by 31st December every year.\nvi. Submit FLA by 15th July every year.\nc) External Commercial Borrowing is the loan fund which a company can avail from foreign lenders at a cheap rate. The following regulatory compliances are to be observed-\ni. For ECB, you need to submit the ECB form to your AD Bank along with the ECB agreement and other documents.\nii. On submitting the documents, RBI allots you the LRN (Loan Registration No.). Please do not get the ECB amount in your account, till you receive the LRN.\niii. ECB proceeds to be utilised as per the details as mentioned in your ECB form.\niv. Make sure to make repayment of the interest and the principal amount as per the loan schedule.\nv. Monthly return to be filed in ECB-2 by 7th day every month.\n5. Any non-compliance of the regulations will result in contravention of FEMA provisions and you may have to go for compounding of contravention on payment of the requisite penalty.\nConclusion: Proper compliance with FEMA regulations is crucial for companies and professionals involved in capital account transactions. By familiarizing themselves with the compliance guidelines for FDI, ODI, and ECB, businesses can avoid costly mistakes. This article has compiled the most common errors encountered during such transactions, aiming to provide valuable insights based on practical experience. By heeding these lessons, companies and professionals can navigate the complexities of FEMA regulations, minimize non-compliance risks, and mitigate the potential penalties associated with contraventions.\n*****\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This article has been prepared in good faith on the basis of information available on the date of publication without any independent verification.

These myths have caused confusion and anxiety among the public. In this article, we aim to debunk these myths and provide clarity on the current status of \u20b92000 bank notes.\nMyth 1: The \u20b92000 bank notes are being withdrawn from circulation.\nReality: There is no official announcement or confirmation regarding the withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes from circulation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for issuing currency notes and any decision regarding the withdrawal of a particular denomination would be communicated through an official statement.\nMyth 2: The withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes is a part of demonetization.\nReality: Demonetization refers to the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. The withdrawal of a specific denomination does not necessarily imply demonetization. To date, there have been no official indications of demonetizing the \u20b92000 bank notes.\nMyth 3: All \u20b92000 bank notes will become worthless if they are withdrawn.\n\n\nReality: In case the RBI decides to withdraw a particular denomination, it typically provides a reasonable window for individuals to exchange their old notes for other valid denominations. This ensures that people are not left with worthless currency. Therefore, if the \u20b92000 bank notes were to be withdrawn, appropriate measures would be taken to facilitate the exchange of these notes within a specified timeframe.\nMyth 4: The withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes is an attempt to promote a cashless economy.\nReality: While promoting digital transactions and moving towards a cashless economy is a long-term goal for many countries, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes is directly linked to this objective. Such decisions are multifaceted and take into account various economic and policy considerations.\nMyth 5: The withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes is a precursor to the introduction of a new higher denomination note.\nReality: Speculation about the introduction of a higher denomination note is not uncommon, but it is important to note that no official information has been released regarding the introduction of a new higher denomination note. Any such decision would require proper communication from the RBI.\nConclusion: It is crucial to rely on accurate information from official sources, such as the RBI, when it comes to matters related to currency withdrawal or demonetization. As of now, there is no official confirmation or announcement about the withdrawal of \u20b92000 bank notes from circulation. The circulation of currency notes is subject to the policies and decisions of the RBI, and any changes will be communicated through appropriate channels.\nRecently Government has clarified these Myths on their twitter handle same are as follows:-\n1. With the \u20b92000 denomination bank notes set to be withdrawn from circulation, there are several misconceptions surrounding it & we are here to shed light on the facts with our myth-busting series!\n\n\n\n2. The discontinuation of \u20b92000 currency notes is driven by a forward-looking vision. Here are some of the reasons for the decision\u2026\n\n3. Yes! The \u20b92000 notes will continue to be legal tender even after September 30, 2023. Your currency remains valid, so keep calm and let\u2019s bust the panic!\n\nNo need to panic or rush to exchange them. Any bank, regardless of account ownership, is authorized to exchange \u20b92,000 currency notes for smaller denominations.\n\n4. As we embrace this change, it is important to note that the exchange of notes shall be provided free of cost!\n\n5. The exchange of \u20b92000 notes into smaller denominations is NOT demonetisation. It\u2019s simply a step to facilitate smoother transactions and meet evolving needs.\n\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/analysis-20-tcs-international-credit-card-usage.html", "title": "Analysis of 20% TCS on International Credit Card Usage: Facts & Implications", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\u00a0The imposition of a 20% Tax Collection at Source (TCS) on international credit card usage has generated discussion and confusion. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation, including an examination of the relevant provisions, background information, and the implications of the changes in TCS rates and the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). It also explores the relief measures offered by the government and the availability of TCS credit.\nBackground:\u00a0The Liberalised Remittance Scheme (Commonly referred to as the \u2018LRS\u2019), introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (Common referred to as the \u2018RBI\u2019), enables resident individuals to remit money abroad for personal purposes without requiring prior approval. The scheme allows remittances up to USD 250,000 per financial year.\nSection 206C(1G) of the Income Tax Act provides for collection of TCS on remittance of the amount under the LRS by resident Individuals and on sale of overseas tour program package to resident individuals.\nVide Finance Act, 2023, the rate of TCS for the specified remittances under LRS and overseas tour program package was revised at 20% effective from 1st July, 2023 from erstwhile 5% which is applicable till 30th June, 2023.\nPage ContentsTCS rate on International Credit Card Usage and RemittanceIs TCS under LRS applicable to Non-residents?Is TCS applicable for purchase of foreign currency or forex pre-paid cards?Understanding the LRS and International Credit Card Usage:Government Offers Relief by Exempting TCS on International Card Transactions:Is Credit of TCS available by filing Income Tax Returns?Is the Rs. 7 Lakh Exemption Threshold Limit Qua the Remitter or Qua the Authorised Dealer?\nTCS rate on International Credit Card Usage and Remittance\nThereby, the effective rates of TCS will be as follows:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTCS rate till 30.06.2023\nTCS rate with effect from 01.07.2023\nRemarks\n\n\n\u00a0\nExemption limit\nRate\nExemption limit\nRate\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution.\n7 lakhs\n0.5%\n7 lakhs\n0.5%\nNo amendment\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above\n7 lakhs\n5%\n7 lakhs\n5%\nNo amendment\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment\n7 lakhs\n5%\n7 lakhs\n5%\nNo amendment\n\n\nLRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc\n7 lakhs\n5%\nNil\n20%\nAmended\n\n\nSale of overseas tour program package\nNIL\n5%\nNil\n20%\nAmended\n\n\n\nIt is evident from the table that, effective from July 1, 2023, there will be a change in the TCS rate to 20% from the current 5% for the sale of overseas tour program packages and remittances under LRS, except for medical and education loan purposes.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/Is TCS under LRS applicable to Non-residents?\nThe LRS applies to resident Individuals. The remittance rules for NRIs for remittance of funds from NRE, NRO and FCNR accounts are not covered by LRS. Therefore, TCS is not applicable for remittance made by non-residents.\nIs TCS applicable for purchase of foreign currency or forex pre-paid cards?\nYes, Tax Collected at Source (TCS) is applicable for the purchase of foreign currency or forex pre-paid cards under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS). When purchasing foreign currency or forex pre-paid cards under the LRS, authorized dealers or banks will collect TCS at the rate of 20%.\nUnderstanding the LRS and International Credit Card Usage:\nThe recent buzz surrounding the imposition of a 20% Tax Collection at Source (TCS) on international credit card usage has caused confusion.\nWhen traveling abroad, a person could use international debit cards, international credit cards or other methods for undertaking the various transactions (for easy understanding, consider it as the LRS transactions at present).\nPreviously, Rule 7 of the Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transaction) Rules, 2000 exempted usage of international credit card for expenses incurred while on travel abroad, from LRS limit. Due to the exemption under the erstwhile rules, expenditures through credit cards were not accounted for the specified LRS limit which led to some individuals exceeding the LRS limit. So, one can say that differential treatment was given for \u2018International Credit Card\u2019 as compared to the \u2018International Debit Card\u2019 which should not be ideally the case without any specific reason.\nHowever, a recent notification on May 16, 2023, removed the LRS exemption given to the use of international credit cards for meeting his expenses when he is abroad. Consequently, payments made through both international debit cards and international credit cards are now treated equally. This removal of the exemption has sparked speculation that a 20% TCS will be imposed on international credit card usage.\nThe removal of the special exemption for international credit cards simply puts them on par with debit cards. As a result, both debit and credit card transactions made overseas will fall under the purview of the LRS, leading to the collection of TCS. Further, there will not be flat 20% TCS on usage of international credit card rather it will be dependent upon the situation as mentioned in supra table i.e., 0.5%, 5% or 20% as applicable in that situation.\nGovernment Offers Relief by Exempting TCS on International Card Transactions:\nTo ease procedural ambiguity and address public concerns, the Government has announced a significant relaxation on 19th May 2023. According to the clarification, any payments made by individuals using their international debit or credit cards, up to Rs. 7 lakh per financial year, will be excluded from the ambit of the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits. Consequently, International credit card or international debit card transactions upto Rs. 7 Lakhs per financial year will not attract any TCS.\nThe initial notification issued on 16th May 2023 aimed to bring international debit and credit cards on an equal footing by removing the exemption previously enjoyed by international credit cards. However, this move inadvertently led to positive outcomes. Instead of eliminating the exemption for international credit cards, the government has decided to extend a similar exemption to international debit cards.\n\n\nIs Credit of TCS available by filing Income Tax Returns?\nYes, the credit of TCS (Tax Collected at Source) is available to the payee under certain conditions. If the TCS payee is a taxpayer, they can claim credit for the TCS against their regular income and adjust it against their income tax liability while filing their income tax return.\nHowever, if the TCS payee is not required to pay any income tax, the only option to claim a refund of TCS is by filing the Return of Income and claiming the TCS refund in that return. The interest on such refund will be calculated starting from the beginning of the next financial year until the grant of the refund.\nIs the Rs. 7 Lakh Exemption Threshold Limit Qua the Remitter or Qua the Authorised Dealer? \nThe exemption threshold limit of Rs. 7 lakhs in respect of LRS remittances towards medical treatment and/or education abroad and/or international debit/credit card payments, is to be considered qua the resident individual (remitter) and not qua the TCS collector or qua the Debit/Credit Card. The aggregate LRS spends of resident individuals, in a financial year, are compiled and monitored by RBI, based on PANs of such individuals.\nIf a resident individual conducts LRS transactions through multiple authorized dealers/bankers or international debit/credit cards, the threshold exemption limit of Rs. 7 lakhs within a year will be calculated based on the collective amount spent across all authorized dealers/bankers and debit/credit cards. It is not assessed independently for each authorized dealer/banker or debit/credit card.\nConclusion:\nIt is essential to dispel the confusion surrounding TCS on international credit card usage. The recent change primarily removes the differential treatment between international debit and credit cards, ensuring that both payment methods are subject to the same regulations. Therefore, it is not the introduction of a new tax but the removal of a previous exemption, resulting in the collection of TCS on overseas transactions made with international\n", "table": ["\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **TCS rate till 30.06.2023** | **TCS rate with effect from 01.07.2023** | **Remarks** |\n|  | **Exemption limit** | **Rate** | **Exemption limit** | **Rate** |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution. | 7 lakhs | 0.5% | 7 lakhs | 0.5% | No amendment |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above | 7 lakhs | 5% | 7 lakhs | 5% | No amendment |\n| LRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment | 7 lakhs | 5% | 7 lakhs | 5% | No amendment |\n| LRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc | 7 lakhs | 5% | Nil | 20% | Amended |\n| Sale of overseas tour program package | NIL | 5% | Nil | 20% | Amended |\n\n"], "table_c": ["<table style=\"height: 578px;\" width=\"545\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"187\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"182\"><strong>TCS rate till 30.06.2023</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"169\"><strong>TCS rate with effect from 01.07.2023</strong></td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"109\"><strong>Remarks</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></td>\n<td width=\"96\"><strong>Exemption limit</strong></td>\n<td width=\"86\"><strong>Rate</strong></td>\n<td width=\"96\"><strong>Exemption limit</strong></td>\n<td width=\"73\"><strong>Rate</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for education abroad If the amount being remitted out is a loan obtained from any approved financial institution.</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">0.5%</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"73\">0.5%</td>\n<td width=\"109\">No amendment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for Education abroad if the remittance is out of own funds and not out of loans as mentioned in (a) above</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"73\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"109\">No amendment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Remittance for medical treatment</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"73\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"109\">No amendment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<td width=\"187\">LRS \u2013 Any other remittance such as gift, emigration, family maintenance, investments etc</td>\n<td width=\"96\">7 lakhs</td>\n<td width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td width=\"96\">Nil</td>\n<td width=\"73\">20%</td>\n<td width=\"109\">Amended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"187\">Sale of overseas tour program package</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"96\">NIL</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"86\">5%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"96\">Nil</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"73\">20%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\" width=\"109\">Amended</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"]}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/withdrawal-rs-2000-notes-exploring-implications-exchange-process.html", "title": "Withdrawal of Rs 2000 Notes: Exploring Implications & Exchange Process", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: In a surprising move, the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has decided to withdraw Rs 2000 notes from the market. This decision has sparked curiosity and speculation across the country. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the rationale behind this decision, delve into the rules for exchanging the notes, and discuss the potential consequences for the Indian economy and its citizens.\nReasons for withdrawal of the Rs. 2000 Bank Note: The primary objective behind the withdrawal of the Rs. 2000 Bank Note is to tackle the issue of black money, which refers to undisclosed wealth that evades taxation. By eliminating the circulation of these high-value notes, which are often favored by individuals involved in illicit activities, the government aims to discourage the holding of unaccounted cash and curb black money. Additionally, withdrawal of the Rs. 2000 Bank Note addresses concerns regarding counterfeit currency, as Rs 2000 notes were particularly susceptible to forgery, posing a threat to the integrity of the Indian currency.\nThe RBI\u2019s Official Announcement: In an official press release on May 19, 2023, the Reserve Bank of India announced the withdrawal of the Rs. 2000 Bank Note while stating that they would continue to be legal tender and also announced that same can be exchanged in banks till 30th September 2023. During this period, individuals will have the opportunity to exchange their currency with the banks. However, there is a maximum exchange limit of 10 notes per day. For individuals wishing to exchange more than 10 notes, they must provide their account details to the respective bank, as amounts exceeding the limit will not be replaced in cash but will be deposited into the individual\u2019s bank account after thorough scrutiny.\nExchange Rules: To ensure a smooth transition, the government has established a specific window for exchanging the Rs 2000 notes that are currently in circulation. During this period, individuals can exchange their notes at their respective banks or post officesor banks or post offices notified by Government. To complete the exchange process, individuals must provide valid identification documents such as Aadhar card, PAN card (Permanent Account Number), Voter ID card (if available), and a valid address proof document. Individuals carrying a significant amount of Rs 2000 notes exceeding the limit set by the RBI and the government can deposit the surplus amount into their bank accounts.\nObjectives and Impact: The sudden withdrawal of\u00a0 on Rs 2000 notes aims to disrupt illegal financial activities, including corruption, terrorism, and money laundering, making such activities more challenging. Additionally, the government envisions a cashless India and sees this step as a move towards digitalization and a digital India.\nConclusion: The withdrawal of the Rs. 2000 Bank Note\u00a0from the market is a significant step taken by the Indian government to address issues related to black money, counterfeit currency, and the promotion of a digital economy. While the move may have certain implications and inconveniences for the public, it aims to create a more transparent and accountable financial system. The long-term effects of this decision will be closely observed, and public opinions on the matter are welcome in the comment section.\n\n\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/overview-rbi-act-1934.html", "title": "Overview of RBI Act 1934", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 is the primary legislation that establishes the framework and governing principles for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of India.

It outlines the consultations and coordination mechanisms between the RBI and the government regarding monetary policy, exchange rate management, and other important matters. The Act also specifies the RBI\u2019s role as the banker to the government and its responsibilities in managing the government\u2019s accounts and transactions.\n7. Enforcement and Penalties: The RBI Act, 1934 provides provisions for enforcement, penalties, and legal consequences for non-compliance with the Act\u2019s provisions. It outlines the powers of the RBI in imposing penalties, issuing directions, and taking legal action against entities that violate the Act or fail to comply with the RBI\u2019s regulations and directions.\nThe RBI Act, 1934 has undergone several amendments over the years to align with the changing economic and financial landscape of India.

One of the compliance requirements that companies engaged in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) or investing in foreign companies, either through joint ventures or wholly owned subsidiaries (referred to as Overseas Direct Investment or ODI), must meet is filing the FLA (Foreign Liabilities and Assets) annual return. This annual return should encompass all foreign investments made by the company, either outgoing or incoming, and must be directly submitted to the Reserve Bank of India.\nWho needs to file the FLA return?\nAccording to the regulations under FEMA, 1999, any company that has engaged in ODI (Outward Foreign Direct Investment) or received FDI is required to file the FLA annual return. The companies must report the FLA for the current financial year, along with the assets and liabilities from the previous year(s). If a company does not possess any foreign assets or liabilities in the current year but has outstanding FDI or ODI from previous year(s), it must file the FLA annual return, indicating the outstanding assets and liabilities.\nTherefore, the following entities are required to file the FLA return:\n1. A Company as defined in Section 1(4) of the Companies Act, 2013.\n2. A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) registered under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008.\n3. Others, including SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Partnership Firms, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), etc.\n\n\nHow to file the FLA return?\nEntities can submit the FLA return through the online web-based portal called Foreign Liabilities and Assets Information Reporting (FLAIR) system. The portal\u2019s address is https://flair.rbi.org.in/fla/faces/pages/login.xhtml.\nThe entity should register on the portal by clicking on \u201cRegistration for New Entity Users.\u201d Fill in the details in the FLA user registration form, upload the required documents (Verification Letter and Authority Letter), and click submit to complete the registration process. After successful registration, the user ID and default password will be sent to the authorized person\u2019s email ID. Using this user ID and password, entities can log in to the FLAIR portal and file the FLA return. The company can download the draft return, review it, and make any necessary corrections before submitting it to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Upon final submission, the reporting Indian company will receive an acknowledgement of the FLA data submitted by the company through the system. No separate email will be sent by the RBI in this regard.\nConsequences of not filing the FLA return:\nAs per the amendment in A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.16 dated September 30, 2022,The Late Submission Fee (LSF) was introduced for reporting delays in Foreign Investment (FI), External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) and Overseas Investment related transactions with effect from November 07, 2017, January 16, 2019, and August 22, 2022 respectively. The imposition of LSF has been standardized to ensure uniformity across functions.\u00a0\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/sovereign-gold-bonds-features-advantages-income-tax-gst.html", "title": "Sovereign Gold Bonds: Features, Advantages, Income tax and GST", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360 Degree analysis on Sovereign gold bonds (SGBs) \nA. Basics of SGBs \n1. SGBs are government securities expressed in grams of gold, allowing the individuals to invest in gold without the strain of safekeeping physical gold. Investors have to pay the issue price in cash and the bonds will be redeemed in cash on maturity. The Bond is issued by RBI on behalf of Government of India.\nB. Features of SGBs \n1. Who can invest in SGBs?\nPersons resident in India as defined under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 are eligible to invest in SGB. Eligible investors include individuals, HUFs, trusts, universities and charitable institutions. Individual investors with subsequent change in residential status from resident to non-resident may continue to hold SGB till early redemption/maturity.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENTAds byPlayback speed1x NormalBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/2.

This payout benefit can be exercised for the 5th, 6th and 7th year of bond tenor and can be exercised on the interest payment dates.\nNow the question comes into mind that what if the bond needs to be encashed prior to 5th year. The sovereign gold bond can be traded in the secondary market i.e on the stock exchange after 14 days from an initial subscription date. For trading on stock exchange, the holding certificate of SGBs has to be digitized and stored in demat account of the investor. Prices at which these bonds are transacted depend on the prevailing gold prices on the sale date, as well as its corresponding demand and supply in the stock market.\nMinimum and Maximum quantity of subscription\n\n\n\n* In case of joint holding, the investment limit of 4 kg will be applied to the first applicant only\n5. Issue price and redemption price of the bonds\nIssue Price: Based on of average of closing price of gold of 999 purity published by the India Bullion and Jewelers Association Ltd (IBJA) for the last 3 business days of the week preceding the subscription period.\nRedemption price: Based on simple average of closing price of gold of 999 purity published by IBJA of previous 3 business days from the date of repayment.\n6.

It\u2019s advisable to consult with legal and financial experts who specialize in foreign exchange transactions and FEMA compliance to ensure that you are in compliance with the latest regulations and to avoid potential legal issues or penalties.\nControls exercised by RBI/MoF under FEMA\nUnder the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) exercise various controls to regulate foreign exchange transactions, external trade, and foreign investments. These controls are put in place to maintain stability in the foreign exchange market, promote economic growth, and protect the interests of the Indian economy. Here are the key controls exercised by RBI and MoF under FEMA:\n1. Licensing and Authorization:\n\nRBI authorizes banks and other financial institutions to act as authorized dealers in foreign exchange. These authorized dealers are responsible for facilitating foreign exchange transactions and ensuring compliance with FEMA regulations.\n\n2.

Monitoring and Surveillance:\n\nRBI and other regulatory bodies conduct ongoing monitoring and surveillance of foreign exchange transactions to detect and prevent irregularities and violations.\n\nIt\u2019s important for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions involved in foreign exchange transactions and foreign investments in India to stay informed about the latest FEMA regulations and to work closely with authorized dealers to ensure compliance. Non-compliance with FEMA regulations can result in significant penalties and legal consequences.\nApprovals under FEMA\nUnder the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India, certain foreign exchange transactions and activities require approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or the Central Government (Ministry of Finance). These approvals are necessary to ensure compliance with FEMA regulations and to monitor and regulate foreign exchange flows. Here are some common approvals required under FEMA:\n1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Approvals:\n\nFDI in sectors that require government approval or fall under the approval route must obtain approval from the Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs) and/or other relevant ministries or departments.\n\n2.

Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB):\n\nWhile the FIPB was abolished in 2017, some legacy cases may still require approval under FEMA, and the relevant authorities would handle them accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to note that FEMA regulations are periodically updated, and the specific approval requirements may change over time. To ensure compliance with current regulations, individuals, businesses, and entities involved in foreign exchange transactions or foreign investments should consult with authorized dealers (usually banks) or legal and financial experts who are well-versed in FEMA regulations. Failure to obtain required approvals can lead to penalties and legal consequences under FEMA.\nRelevant Master Directions/Rules under FEMA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued several Master Directions and Rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) to provide detailed guidelines and regulations for various foreign exchange transactions and activities in India.

Documentation and Reporting:\n\nProper documentation of the valuation process and reporting of valuation results are essential for compliance. This documentation helps demonstrate that transactions and investments have been valued correctly in line with FEMA regulations.\n\n11. Independent Valuation:\n\nIn some cases, independent third-party valuations may be required, especially when dealing with cross-border transactions or when valuation needs to be free from conflicts of interest.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the specific requirements for valuation may vary depending on the nature of the transaction, the assets involved, and the FEMA regulations applicable at the time. Valuation under FEMA is a critical aspect of compliance, and individuals, businesses, and entities should work with qualified professionals, such as chartered accountants or valuation experts, to ensure accurate and compliant valuations. Additionally, staying informed about changes in FEMA regulations related to valuation is crucial to ensure ongoing compliance.\nWhat are the provisions that will be attracted for FDI/ODI/repatriation out of India/Capex imports/Goods imports/Exports of goods and services under FEMA\nUnder the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India, various provisions and regulations apply to different types of foreign exchange transactions and activities, including Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Overseas Direct Investment (ODI), repatriation of funds out of India, capital expenditure (Capex) imports, goods imports, and exports of goods and services.

It\u2019s advisable to consult with authorized dealers, legal experts, or compliance professionals for specific transaction-related guidance and compliance requirements.\nPenalties for contravention\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India prescribes penalties for contraventions of its provisions. These penalties are intended to ensure compliance with FEMA regulations and deter individuals, businesses, and entities from violating the law. The penalties for contravention under FEMA can vary depending on the nature and severity of the violation. Here are some common penalties and consequences for contravention of FEMA provisions:\n1.

Injunctions and Seizure Orders:\n\nAuthorities may issue injunctions to prevent further contravention and may also issue orders to seize documents, assets, or properties related to the contravention.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the specific penalties and consequences can vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. The severity of the penalty often depends on factors such as the amount involved, the intent of the contravention, and the frequency of violations.\nTo avoid penalties and legal consequences under FEMA, individuals, businesses, and entities involved in foreign exchange transactions and activities should ensure strict compliance with FEMA regulations and stay updated with changes to the law. Consulting with legal and financial experts who specialize in FEMA compliance is advisable to ensure that transactions are conducted in accordance with the law and to avoid contraventions.\nWhat could be called contraventions under FEMA\nContraventions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India refer to violations or breaches of the provisions and regulations outlined in FEMA.

While they have distinct purposes and scopes, there are areas of overlap and interplay between the two acts, particularly concerning the incorporation and operation of companies in India. Here\u2019s an overview of the relationship between FEMA and the Companies Act, 2013:\n1. Incorporation of Companies:\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013 governs the incorporation, management, and operation of companies in India. FEMA does not directly deal with the incorporation process. However, FEMA regulations may apply when foreign entities invest in Indian companies or when Indian companies engage in certain foreign transactions.\n\n2. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):\n\nFEMA plays a significant role in regulating foreign investments in Indian companies. The Companies Act primarily deals with the structure and governance of companies, while FEMA sets out the rules and conditions for foreign investors, including permissible sectors, sectoral caps, and reporting requirements.\n\n3. Ownership and Shareholding:\n\nUnder the Companies Act, the ownership structure, share issuance, and governance of Indian companies are detailed. However, FEMA regulations may impose restrictions on foreign ownership in certain sectors and stipulate the procedures for issuing shares to foreign investors.\n\n4. Reporting and Compliance:\n\nBoth acts require companies to adhere to specific reporting and compliance requirements. The Companies Act mandates the filing of various documents with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), while FEMA requires reporting to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or authorized dealers for foreign exchange transactions and investments.\n\n5. Transfer of Shares:\n\nWhile the Companies Act governs the transfer of shares within Indian companies, FEMA regulates the transfer of shares involving non-resident shareholders, including the reporting of such transfers to the RBI or authorized dealers.\n\n6. Merger and Amalgamation:\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013 provides provisions for mergers and amalgamations involving Indian companies. In the case of cross-border mergers, FEMA regulations apply to foreign companies seeking to merge with Indian companies.\n\n7. External Commercial Borrowings (ECB):\n\nFEMA sets out rules and limits for Indian companies seeking to raise funds through external commercial borrowings. These regulations complement the Companies Act\u2019s provisions related to borrowing and raising capital.\n\n8. Compliance with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Guidelines:\n\nIndian companies, while adhering to the Companies Act, must also ensure compliance with FEMA guidelines issued by the RBI, especially in cases involving foreign exchange transactions, overseas investments, and borrowings.\n\n9. Penalties and Legal Consequences:\n\nContraventions of both the Companies Act and FEMA can lead to penalties and legal consequences, but the nature and severity of penalties differ.\n\nIn summary, the Companies Act, 2013, primarily focuses on the incorporation, governance, and internal operations of companies in India. FEMA, on the other hand, deals with foreign exchange transactions, foreign investments, and cross-border transactions. The relationship between the two acts arises when Indian companies engage in activities involving foreign entities or foreign exchange, and compliance with both sets of regulations is crucial to conducting business legally and efficiently in India, particularly in cases of foreign investments and international business operations.\nWhat is Capital Flight under FEMA\nCapital flight, under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India, refers to the illegal or unauthorized movement of capital (financial assets) out of the country. This term is often associated with the unlawful transfer or conversion of assets, such as money, securities, or property, from one country to another without complying with the foreign exchange regulations and controls in place.\nCapital flight can take various forms, including:\n1. Illegal Transfers: When individuals, businesses, or entities move funds or assets abroad without obtaining the necessary approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or authorized dealers, it is considered illegal capital flight.\n2. Money Laundering: Capital flight can be associated with money laundering, where individuals or entities attempt to conceal the source of funds by transferring them abroad.\n3. Tax Evasion: In some cases, capital flight may be driven by tax evasion motives, where individuals or entities move assets offshore to avoid taxes or reporting requirements.\n4. Avoidance of Regulatory Controls: Capital flight can also occur when individuals or entities seek to circumvent capital controls or regulatory restrictions imposed by the government.\n5. Asset Concealment: Some individuals or entities may engage in capital flight to hide assets from creditors, legal actions, or other authorities.\n6. Foreign Investment Violations: Violating FEMA provisions related to foreign investments, such as overinvestment in overseas ventures, can also be considered a form of capital flight.\n7. Repatriation Violations: Failing to repatriate funds or assets held abroad back to India within the prescribed time frames is another form of capital flight.\nCapital flight is illegal and is subject to penalties and legal consequences under FEMA. The government of India and the RBI closely monitor capital flows to detect and deter such activities. To address the issue of capital flight, India has implemented stringent controls and reporting requirements for cross-border financial transactions. Compliance with these regulations is essential to ensure that capital movements are conducted within the framework of the law.\nPenalties for capital flight under FEMA can include monetary fines, confiscation of assets, prosecution, and imprisonment, depending on the severity of the violation. Additionally, individuals or entities found guilty of capital flight may face reputational damage and difficulties in conducting future financial transactions.\nIt\u2019s important for individuals and businesses to be aware of and comply with FEMA regulations to avoid inadvertent violations and to ensure that their financial transactions are conducted legally and transparently. Consulting with legal and financial experts who specialize in FEMA compliance can help ensure that cross-border transactions are conducted in accordance with the law.\nIn Tata Sons vs NTT Docomo case, why RBI was not allowed as an intervening party?\nThe Tata Sons vs. NTT Docomo case pertains to a dispute between Tata Sons (the Indian company) and NTT Docomo (the Japanese company) over an agreement they had entered into regarding the exit of NTT Docomo from their joint venture in India. The dispute centered on the payment of a guaranteed price by Tata Sons to NTT Docomo upon the exit, which raised complex issues related to foreign exchange regulations and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.\nThe RBI had certain guidelines and regulations in place at the time that imposed restrictions on the payment of guaranteed returns or exit prices to foreign investors, as such payments were seen as potentially violating foreign exchange control norms. In the Tata Sons vs. NTT Docomo case, NTT Docomo sought enforcement of the exit price guaranteed in the agreement, while Tata Sons raised concerns about the potential violation of RBI guidelines.\nRegarding the RBI\u2019s involvement as an intervening party in the case, it\u2019s important to note that in India, regulatory bodies like the RBI do not typically participate directly in commercial disputes between private parties. Instead, they issue guidelines and regulations, and it is the responsibility of the parties involved in transactions to ensure that they comply with these regulations.\nIn this case, the RBI had already conveyed its stance on the matter through its guidelines and regulations on guaranteed returns and exit prices for foreign investors. The issue of whether Tata Sons could make the payment to NTT Docomo without violating RBI guidelines was at the heart of the dispute.\nThe dispute was ultimately resolved through negotiations between Tata Sons and NTT Docomo, leading to a settlement where Tata Sons agreed to pay NTT Docomo a reduced amount. This settlement was reached after discussions between the parties and without direct intervention by the RBI.\nWhile the RBI did not directly intervene as a party in the case, the case did highlight the challenges and complexities of doing business in India, particularly in matters involving foreign exchange regulations and compliance with RBI guidelines. Businesses and investors operating in India often seek legal advice to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with RBI and other regulatory authorities\u2019 requirements.\nCan the Indian portfolio company have a separate agreement independent of FEMA for exit of investment?\nNo, an Indian portfolio company cannot have a separate agreement independent of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for the exit of investment by a foreign investor. FEMA regulations are mandatory and govern all foreign investments in India, including the exit of such investments. Any agreement related to the exit of a foreign investment must be in compliance with FEMA regulations.\nHere are some key points to consider:\n1. FEMA Compliance: All foreign investments, whether they involve Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), must comply with FEMA regulations. These regulations dictate the conditions, limits, and procedures for investments and divestments by foreign investors in India.\n2. Exit Routes: FEMA provides specific exit routes for foreign investors in Indian companies, which may include sale of shares on recognized stock exchanges, sale to a resident Indian, or in certain cases, through buyback arrangements. The exit must conform to the regulations set forth in FEMA.\n3. Pricing Guidelines: FEMA regulations often include pricing guidelines for the exit of foreign investments, such as pricing at fair market value or a predetermined formula. These guidelines aim to prevent the transfer of assets at prices that do not reflect their true value.\n4. Reporting Requirements: Foreign investors are required to report their exit transactions to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or authorized dealers as specified in FEMA. This reporting ensures transparency and compliance with FEMA regulations.\n5. Prior Approvals: In some cases, prior approvals from the RBI may be required for the exit of foreign investments, especially when the exit involves sector-specific conditions or restrictions.\n6. Agreements and Documentation: While parties can have agreements related to the exit of investments, these agreements must align with FEMA regulations. Any clauses or terms in such agreements that violate FEMA guidelines would not be enforceable.\nIt is crucial for both the foreign investor and the Indian portfolio company to consult with legal and financial experts familiar with FEMA compliance when structuring exit agreements. The agreements should be drafted in a way that ensures compliance with FEMA and other applicable Indian laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with FEMA regulations can result in penalties and legal consequences. Therefore, it is essential to navigate the exit process in a manner that adheres to the provisions of FEMA and other relevant Indian laws while protecting the interests of the parties involved.\nHow does FEMA regulate Indian Economy?\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in India regulates various aspects of the country\u2019s economy by managing foreign exchange transactions and related activities. FEMA plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of India\u2019s external trade and payments, safeguarding its foreign exchange reserves, and ensuring compliance with foreign exchange controls. Here\u2019s how FEMA regulates the Indian economy:\n1. Control of Foreign Exchange: FEMA provides the legal framework for regulating foreign exchange transactions in India. It empowers the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government to control and monitor the movement of foreign exchange, ensuring that foreign exchange transactions are conducted in a controlled and regulated manner.\n2. Foreign Investments: FEMA regulates foreign investments in India, including Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI). It sets sectoral caps, conditions, and reporting requirements for foreign investors. FEMA promotes foreign investments in sectors that align with the country\u2019s economic priorities while safeguarding national interests.\n3. Capital Account Transactions: FEMA governs capital account transactions, including investments, borrowings, and remittances. It lays down guidelines for individuals, businesses, and entities engaged in capital account transactions to ensure that they are conducted within the framework of the law.\n4. External Commercial Borrowings (ECB): FEMA regulates external commercial borrowings by Indian companies. It imposes limits, conditions, and reporting requirements to manage external debt and ensure that borrowings do not pose a risk to the country\u2019s financial stability.\n5. Trade Transactions: FEMA oversees trade transactions, both imports and exports. It mandates the use of authorized dealers (usually banks) for foreign exchange transactions related to trade. FEMA also establishes reporting requirements and procedures for trade transactions.\n6. Exchange Controls: FEMA provides the legal basis for exchange controls, including the regulation of exchange rates. The RBI manages the exchange rate regime and intervenes in the foreign exchange market to maintain stability and prevent excessive volatility.\n7. Reporting and Compliance: Individuals, businesses, and entities engaged in foreign exchange transactions are required to comply with FEMA regulations and report these transactions to the RBI or authorized dealers as specified. Compliance ensures transparency and accountability in foreign exchange transactions.\n8. Foreign Assets and Liabilities: FEMA requires residents to report their foreign assets and liabilities, helping authorities monitor the country\u2019s external financial position and assess its impact on the balance of payments.\n9. Penalties and Enforcement: FEMA provides for penalties and legal consequences for contraventions of its provisions. Non-compliance can result in monetary fines, confiscation of assets, or even criminal prosecution.\n10. Foreign Exchange Reserves: FEMA helps manage India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, ensuring they are used effectively to support the country\u2019s economic and financial stability.\nIn summary, FEMA is a critical component of India\u2019s economic regulatory framework, governing foreign exchange transactions, foreign investments, and capital flows. By controlling and regulating these aspects, FEMA helps safeguard the stability of India\u2019s external trade and payments, fosters foreign investments, and ensures compliance with foreign exchange controls to protect the country\u2019s economic interests.\nHow does ADs ensure non-violation of FEMA?\nAuthorized Dealers (ADs) in India play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). ADs are typically banks authorized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to facilitate foreign exchange transactions and financial activities on behalf of individuals, businesses, and entities. Here\u2019s how ADs help ensure non-violation of FEMA:\n1. Customer Due Diligence (CDD): ADs are responsible for conducting thorough customer due diligence before opening foreign exchange accounts or processing transactions. This includes verifying the identity and credentials of customers to ensure they are eligible for the intended transactions and investments.\n2. Know Your Customer (KYC) Procedures: ADs implement KYC procedures as mandated by RBI. They collect relevant documents and information from customers to establish their identities and the nature of their foreign exchange transactions.\n3. Transaction Monitoring: ADs monitor foreign exchange transactions conducted by customers. They track the volume, frequency, and nature of transactions to identify any suspicious or unusual activities that may indicate a violation of FEMA.\n4. Documentation and Reporting: ADs ensure that customers complete all necessary documentation and reporting requirements as per FEMA regulations. They guide customers in filling out forms, declarations, and applications accurately and submitting them to the RBI when required.\n5. Verification of Compliance: ADs verify that transactions comply with FEMA regulations, including sectoral caps, pricing guidelines, and reporting requirements. They may seek clarifications or additional documentation from customers to ensure compliance.\n6. Examination of Documents: ADs review supporting documents, such as invoices, contracts, and agreements, to ensure that they align with the nature of the transaction and comply with FEMA regulations.\n7. Reporting to RBI: ADs are responsible for reporting foreign exchange transactions to the RBI in the prescribed formats and within the stipulated time frames. This reporting is crucial for RBI\u2019s monitoring and regulatory purposes.\n8. Advisory Role: ADs provide advisory services to customers, guiding them on the legal and regulatory aspects of foreign exchange transactions. They ensure that customers are aware of their responsibilities under FEMA.\n9. Record Keeping: ADs maintain records of foreign exchange transactions and customer documentation as required by RBI guidelines. These records serve as evidence of compliance and are available for regulatory inspection.\n10. Training and Compliance Education: ADs often conduct training and awareness programs for their staff to ensure they are knowledgeable about FEMA regulations and can provide accurate guidance to customers.\n11. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures: ADs implement AML measures to detect and prevent money laundering and other financial crimes associated with foreign exchange transactions.\n12. Red Flags: ADs are trained to recognize red flags that may indicate potential violations of FEMA. If they identify such flags, they may escalate the matter for further investigation and reporting.\n13. Internal Controls: ADs establish internal controls and compliance mechanisms to ensure that their operations align with FEMA regulations and RBI guidelines.\nBy actively performing these functions, ADs act as gatekeepers and intermediaries to help ensure that foreign exchange transactions and activities carried out by customers are in compliance with FEMA. They are an essential part of the regulatory framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and adherence to foreign exchange controls in India.\nIs Indian FEMA a measure of control on overseas investors?\nYes, the Indian Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) is a measure of control on overseas investors. FEMA is a set of regulations and guidelines that govern foreign exchange transactions and foreign investments in India. It is designed to manage and regulate capital flows into and out of the country, as well as to safeguard India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, balance of payments, and economic stability.\nFEMA imposes various controls and conditions on overseas investors, including:\n1. Foreign Investment Limits: FEMA sets sectoral caps and conditions on foreign investments in different sectors of the Indian economy. These limits restrict the level of foreign ownership and control in certain sectors, ensuring that sensitive sectors are not dominated by foreign investors.\n2. Reporting Requirements: Overseas investors are required to report their investments to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or authorized dealers, providing details of the investment, the source of funds, and other relevant information. This reporting ensures transparency and accountability.\n3. Pricing Guidelines: FEMA often prescribes pricing guidelines for foreign investments, ensuring that investments are made at fair market value and are not unduly influenced by the parties involved.\n4. Exit Mechanisms: FEMA regulates the exit of foreign investments from India, specifying the conditions and procedures for repatriation of funds and the transfer of assets. These controls help prevent the rapid outflow of capital.\n5. Borrowing and Debt Instruments: FEMA sets limits and conditions on external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign debt instruments issued by Indian companies. These controls are in place to manage external debt and protect the country\u2019s financial stability.\n6. Repatriation Restrictions: FEMA contains provisions related to the repatriation of funds and assets by foreign investors. It ensures that repatriation is done within the prescribed limits and complies with the law.\n7. Sectoral Regulations: In certain sensitive sectors, FEMA regulations may require prior government approval for foreign investments, imposing additional layers of control.\nWhile FEMA does impose controls on overseas investors, it is important to note that these controls are not meant to deter foreign investment but rather to regulate it in a manner that safeguards India\u2019s economic interests, national security, and financial stability. The Indian government welcomes foreign investment and has taken steps to simplify and streamline the investment process in recent years.\nForeign investors are encouraged to work within the framework of FEMA and comply with its regulations. Compliance with FEMA ensures that foreign investments are made in accordance with the law and provides a level playing field for all investors, both domestic and foreign. It also helps maintain a stable and predictable investment climate in India.\nHow does Indian FEMA work with similar exchange control laws prevailing in countries which have business connection with India?\nWhen Indian businesses and individuals engage in cross-border transactions with countries that have their own exchange control laws and regulations, it can create a complex legal and regulatory landscape. In such cases, it\u2019s essential to understand how Indian FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) works in conjunction with the exchange control laws of the other countries to ensure compliance and facilitate international business activities. Here\u2019s an overview of how this coordination typically works:\n1. Understanding Dual Compliance: Indian entities conducting business or investments abroad and foreign entities operating in India must navigate the foreign exchange control regulations of both India (under FEMA) and the other country involved. This requires an understanding of the requirements, restrictions, and reporting obligations in both jurisdictions.\n2. Compliance with Indian FEMA: Indian businesses and individuals must adhere to the provisions of FEMA when engaging in cross-border transactions. This includes reporting requirements, sectoral caps, pricing guidelines, and conditions related to foreign investments, borrowings, and remittances.\n3. Compliance with Foreign Exchange Control Laws: Similarly, entities based in other countries must comply with their respective exchange control laws and regulations when dealing with Indian entities. This may involve obtaining approvals, adhering to investment restrictions, and fulfilling reporting obligations.\n4. Currency Convertibility: Exchange control laws often govern the convertibility of a country\u2019s currency. Indian entities may need to understand whether the foreign currency involved in the transaction is fully convertible or subject to restrictions in the other country, and vice versa.\n5. Bilateral Agreements and Treaties: Bilateral agreements and treaties between countries can play a significant role in facilitating cross-border transactions and investments. These agreements may provide exemptions, preferential treatment, or streamlined procedures for certain types of transactions.\n6. Authorized Dealers and Banks: Authorized Dealers (ADs), which are typically banks, act as intermediaries for foreign exchange transactions in India. They help Indian entities navigate FEMA compliance and may also assist with foreign exchange controls in other countries through correspondent banking relationships.\n7. Legal and Financial Advice: Given the complexity of cross-border transactions and the need for dual compliance, it is advisable for businesses and individuals to seek legal and financial advice from professionals with expertise in international trade, foreign exchange regulations, and compliance with the laws of multiple jurisdictions.\n8. Documentation and Record-Keeping: Thorough documentation of transactions and compliance records is crucial. Proper record-keeping helps demonstrate compliance with both Indian FEMA and foreign exchange control laws and provides evidence in case of audits or investigations.\n9. Currency Exchange Mechanisms: Understanding the mechanisms for currency conversion, including the use of authorized channels and the availability of foreign exchange reserves, is essential for smooth cross-border transactions.\n10. Monitoring Regulatory Changes: Exchange control laws and regulations can change over time. Staying updated on regulatory changes in both India and the foreign country is crucial to maintaining compliance. In summary, Indian FEMA operates alongside the exchange control laws of other countries when entities engage in international business transactions. It is essential for businesses and individuals to navigate these regulations carefully and ensure compliance to facilitate cross-border trade, investments, and financial transactions while avoiding legal and regulatory issues. Expert advice and due diligence are key to successfully managing these complexities.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/devaluation-remedy-adverse-balance-payments.html", "title": "Is Devaluation the most effective remedy to correct the adverse balance of payments situation?\u201d", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement that devaluation is the most effective remedy to correct an adverse balance of payments situation requires a critical examination. While devaluation can have certain effects on a country\u2019s balance of payments, it is not a standalone solution and has both benefits and drawbacks. Let\u2019s examine this statement with the help of an example:\nDevaluation is the deliberate reduction in the value of a country\u2019s currency in relation to other currencies, making exports relatively cheaper and imports relatively more expensive. This can potentially lead to the following effects on the balance of payments:\n1. Improving Export Competitiveness: Devaluation can make a country\u2019s exports more price competitive in international markets. As the local currency weakens, foreign buyers can purchase goods and services from the devaluing country at lower prices. This can stimulate export growth, increase export revenues, and potentially improve the trade balance.\nFor example, let\u2019s consider a scenario where Country A devalues its currency. As a result, its goods become cheaper for foreign buyers. This can lead to an increase in export volumes and revenues, potentially improving Country A\u2019s trade balance.\n2. Discouraging Imports: Devaluation can make imported goods relatively more expensive for domestic consumers. As the local currency weakens, it requires more of the domestic currency to purchase the same amount of foreign currency needed to import goods. This can reduce the demand for imported goods, leading to a decrease in import volumes and potentially improving the trade balance.\nContinuing with the previous example, the devaluation of Country A\u2019s currency can make imports more expensive. Domestic consumers may shift their preferences towards locally produced goods, leading to a decrease in imports and a potential improvement in the trade balance.\nHowever, it is important to critically examine the statement and consider the drawbacks and limitations of devaluation:\n1. Inflationary Pressures: Devaluation can lead to higher import costs, which can in turn contribute to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy. If imports become more expensive, it can increase the cost of raw materials, intermediate goods, and finished products. This can have a negative impact on domestic consumers, eroding their purchasing power and potentially leading to social and economic challenges.\n2. Dependence on External Factors: The effectiveness of devaluation in improving the balance of payments depends on various external factors such as the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, global economic conditions, and the competitiveness of other countries. If global demand for a country\u2019s exports is weak or if other countries engage in currency devaluations as well, the potential benefits of devaluation may be limited.\n3. Capital Flight and Investor Confidence: Devaluation can lead to concerns among foreign investors and result in capital flight. When a country devalues its currency, investors may lose confidence in the stability of the economy and decide to withdraw their investments. This can negatively impact the country\u2019s balance of payments as it experiences a net outflow of capital.\n\nReturning to the example, the devaluation of Country A\u2019s currency may result in capital flight as foreign investors lose confidence in the stability of the country\u2019s economy. This can counterbalance the positive effects of improved export competitiveness.\n4. Debt Burden: Devaluation can have implications for a country\u2019s debt burden, especially if it has borrowed in foreign currencies. When the domestic currency is devalued, the value of the foreign currency-denominated debt increases in terms of the domestic currency. This can make it more challenging for the country to service its debt obligations, as more domestic currency is required to make interest and principal payments.\nBut now the question definitely arise as what can be the best alternative if a country does not want to go for devaluation having regards to the capital flight and many other serious repercussions.\nWhen faced with economic challenges, countries have various alternatives to devaluation that they can consider. These alternatives aim to address the issues without resorting to reducing the value of the currency. Here are some common alternatives to devaluation:\n1. Monetary Policy Adjustments: Instead of devaluing the currency, a country can use monetary policy tools to influence the domestic economy. For example, the central bank can adjust interest rates to control inflation, stimulate economic growth, or encourage investment. By managing interest rates, the country can influence borrowing costs and investment levels, which can have an impact on exchange rates indirectly.\n2. Fiscal Policy Measures: Governments can implement fiscal policy measures, such as adjusting tax rates, government spending, and public investment, to stimulate economic growth and improve the balance of payments. By controlling government expenditures and revenues, countries can influence the overall demand and supply dynamics within the economy, potentially reducing the need for devaluation.\n3. Structural Reforms: Implementing structural reforms can address underlying issues in the economy that are affecting competitiveness and trade imbalances. These reforms can include improving infrastructure, enhancing labor market flexibility, promoting innovation and technology adoption, and reducing regulatory burdens. By improving the overall business environment and increasing productivity, countries can enhance their competitiveness without resorting to devaluation.\n4. Exchange Rate Pegging: Instead of allowing the currency to float freely, a country can peg its currency to another currency or a basket of currencies. This involves fixing the exchange rate within a specified range or at a specific value relative to the chosen currency. By pegging the currency, the country aims to provide stability and predictability in exchange rates, which can attract foreign investment and promote trade.\n5. Export Promotion Policies: Governments can implement policies and incentives to boost exports, such as providing export subsidies, improving trade facilitation, and promoting export-oriented industries. By focusing on expanding exports, countries can enhance their foreign exchange earnings and improve the balance of payments without resorting to devaluation.\n6. Regional Cooperation: Countries can collaborate with neighboring nations to promote regional integration and cooperation. Regional trade agreements, customs unions, and common markets can facilitate trade among member countries and create a larger market for goods and services. By promoting regional trade, countries can reduce dependence on external markets and mitigate the need for devaluation.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of these alternatives can vary depending on the specific economic circumstances of a country. The choice of alternative measures should consider the underlying causes of the economic challenges, the country\u2019s economic structure, and the potential short-term and long-term implications of the chosen policies. Additionally, a comprehensive approach that combines multiple strategies may be more effective in addressing economic imbalances and promoting sustainable growth.\nIn conclusion, while devaluation can have certain positive effects on a country\u2019s balance of payments by stimulating exports and discouraging imports, it is not a panacea and has limitations and drawbacks. Devaluation should be considered as part of a comprehensive set of policies and measures to address an adverse balance of payments situation. It should be accompanied by structural reforms, productivity improvements, diversification of the economy, and appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to ensure sustainable and balanced economic growth.\nThe author can be reached at cagyatigupta@gmail.com\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/reserve-bank-india-withdraw-rs-2000-banknotes-circulation.html", "title": "Reserve Bank of India to Withdraw Rs 2,000 Banknotes from Circulation", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently made a significant decision to withdraw the circulation of Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes. While these notes will continue to be legal tender, the RBI has set a deadline of September 30, 2023, for their exchange. This move aligns with the RBI\u2019s \u201cClean Note Policy\u201d and aims to complete the withdrawal process efficiently. The central bank has instructed all banks to provide deposit and exchange facilities for Rs 2,000 banknotes until the specified cut-off date.\nReasons for Withdrawal: The decision to withdraw the Rs 2,000 banknotes stems from several factors. Primarily, a substantial portion (approximately 89%) of these banknotes were issued prior to March 2017 and have now reached their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years. As a result, the total value of Rs 2,000 notes in circulation has significantly decreased over time. Additionally, data indicates that this particular denomination is not commonly used for daily transactions. The RBI has also emphasized that an ample supply of banknotes in other denominations remains available to meet the public\u2019s currency requirements.\nWithdrawal Process and Exchanges: To facilitate a smooth transition, the RBI has instructed banks to cease issuing Rs 2,000 currency notes with immediate effect. Starting from May 23, 2023, individuals will be able to exchange Rs 2,000 banknotes for banknotes of other denominations, up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time. This approach ensures operational convenience and aims to minimize disruptions in regular banking activities during the withdrawal period.\nBackground and Achieved Objective: The Rs 2,000 denomination banknote was introduced in November 2016 following the demonetization of Rs 1,000 and old Rs 500 banknotes. At that time, the objective behind introducing the Rs 2,000 notes was to meet the immediate currency requirements. However, as currency availability improved over time, with an adequate supply of banknotes in other denominations, the need for the Rs 2,000 banknotes diminished. Consequently, the printing of these banknotes had already been discontinued during the fiscal year 2018-19.\nConclusion: The RBI\u2019s decision to withdraw the Rs 2,000 banknotes from circulation signifies a strategic step in line with its Clean Note Policy. By setting a deadline for exchange and ensuring that adequate facilities are provided by banks, the central bank aims to smoothly complete the withdrawal process. Individuals are encouraged to exchange their Rs 2,000 banknotes before September 30, 2023, to ensure a seamless transition. With this move, the RBI seeks to maintain an efficient and up-to-date currency system in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/liaison-office-india-eligibility-criteria-permitted-activities-approval-process.html", "title": "Liaison Office In India: Eligibility Criteria, Permitted Activities & Approval Process", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOREIGN ENTITY\u2019S LIAISON OFFICE\nEstablishing a Liaison Office (LO) is a common approach for foreign companies looking to enter the Indian market.

FEMA replaced the earlier Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) and introduced a more liberal and modern framework for regulating foreign exchange transactions in India. Here is an overview of FEMA, 1999:\n1. Objective: The primary objective of FEMA is to facilitate external trade and payments, promote orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market in India, and conserve foreign exchange reserves. It aims to regulate and control foreign exchange transactions to ensure stability in the country\u2019s external sector.\n2. Applicability: FEMA applies to all transactions involving foreign exchange and foreign securities. It is applicable to individuals, companies, banks, and other entities engaged in international trade, foreign investments, borrowing, lending, remittances, and other cross-border transactions.\n3. Regulatory Authority: FEMA grants regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the central authority responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of the Act. The RBI is empowered to issue regulations, rules, and guidelines to govern foreign exchange transactions and monitor compliance.\n4. Current Account Transactions: FEMA distinguishes between current account transactions and capital account transactions. Current account transactions, which involve regular trade and day-to-day foreign exchange transactions, are generally permitted without restrictions. This allows for the smooth conduct of international trade, remittances, and payments for various current account purposes.\n5. Capital Account Transactions: Capital account transactions, which involve investments, borrowing, lending, and other forms of capital movement, are regulated under FEMA. The Act provides guidelines and restrictions on such transactions, with the objective of maintaining stability and avoiding excessive volatility in the capital flows.\n6. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): FEMA regulates foreign direct investment in India. It sets out the rules and procedures for foreign investors to make investments in Indian companies or sectors, subject to certain conditions and sector-specific limits. FEMA also governs repatriation of capital and profits by foreign investors.\n7. Enforcement and Penalties: FEMA empowers the authorities to enforce its provisions and take action against violations. The Act provides for penalties, fines, and confiscation of assets for contraventions of its provisions. Adjudicating authorities, such as the Directorate of Enforcement, are responsible for investigating violations and imposing penalties.\n8. Liberalization and Simplification: FEMA introduced several liberalization measures to simplify and streamline foreign exchange transactions. It shifted the focus from controls and permissions to a more compliance-based framework. FEMA aimed to encourage foreign investments, promote ease of doing business, and facilitate cross-border trade and payments.\nIt\u2019s important to note that FEMA is subject to periodic amendments to reflect changing economic conditions and policy priorities. Individuals and entities engaging in foreign exchange transactions should refer to the latest provisions and regulations under FEMA and seek professional advice when dealing with foreign exchange matters.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/regulatory-overlaps-administration-fema-laws.html", "title": "Regulatory Overlaps in Administration of FEMA Laws", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was enacted in 1999 by the Parliament to facilitate external trade payments and regulate foreign exchange transactions. It replaced the FERA Act of 1973 as a part of India\u2019s financial sector reform. The FEMA Act broadly divided foreign exchange transactions into two parts- current account transactions and capital account transactions. The regulatory framework between the central government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was also created through the FEMA Act.\nIn this post, I will critically analyze the recent amendments to the FEMA Act and the rules and regulations issued by the RBI and central government, and how these changes affect the regulatory structure of FEMA. The author argues that despite the structural changes brought by the enactment of the Finance Act, 2015 and the amendments to the FEMA and the subsequent rules and regulations issued by the RBI and the central government there exist regulatory issues and clarity is needed on various interpretative issues.\n\nTHE BASIC FRAMEWORK OF THE FEMA ACT \nThe FEMA Act divides foreign exchange transactions into two broad categories- capital account transactions and current account transactions. Section 5 of the FEMA regulates current account transactions and the proviso to the section allows the central government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to impose reasonable restrictions on current account transactions. Similarly, Section 6 of the FEMA regulates capital account transactions. Subclause (2) of Section 6 allows the RBI in consultation with the central government to specify any class or classes of capital account transactions that are permissible and the limit to which the foreign exchange would be admissible.\nSince the enactment of the FEMA in 1999 when it came to the oversight and regulation of foreign investments in India, there were regulatory overlaps. The Ministry of Finance, which is a part of the Central Government, was still responsible for formulating policies for foreign direct investment (\u201cFDI\u201d) in India, even if the Reserve Bank of India (\u201cRBI\u201d) was the regulatory agency responsible for developing the laws and guidelines relevant to the issuance or transfer of securities. When the RBI adopted the stated FDI policy into its present foreign exchange laws through master directives issued by it, the separation of powers became frequently unclear. However, there were several cases where the FDI policy was not properly integrated or applied to the foreign exchange regulations.\nRESTRUCTURED FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGULATORY MECHANISM UNDER FEMA\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange management regime. In 2019 the Ministry of Finance notified Sections 139, 143, and 144 of the Finance Act, 2015 which amended Sections 6, 46, and 47 of the FEMA. Post these amendments RBI now had the power to specify any class or classes of capital account transactions involving debt instruments and make regulations for the same as mandated by amended Section 6 read with amended Section 47 of the FEMA and the central government now had the power to prescribe any class or classes of capital account transactions not involving debt instruments and make rules for the same as mandated by amended Section 6 read with Section 46 of the FEMA.\nIn other words, the RBI now had the power to frame regulations for capital account transactions involving debt instruments and the central government had the power to make rules for foreign exchange transactions involving non-debt instruments. The changes were implemented by the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 (Non-debt Instruments Rules or NDI Rules) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019 (Debt Instruments Regulations or DI Regulations). These replaced the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations, 2017 (TISPRO Regulations) as well as the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition of Transfer of Immovable Property in India) Regulations, 2018 (ATIP Regulations).\nThese legislations bring several important changes in terms of how the provisions of the FEMA Act will be enforced. This part of the paper will deal with some of these changes keeping in mind the basic research question of this paper which is an examination of the division of power between the RBI and the Central Government.\nChanges in Definitions and introduction of new definitions\nThe NDI Rules and the DI regulations have both added new definitions for terms like debt instruments, non-debt instruments, and equity investments and modified definitions for terms like investment vehicle and hybrid securities. The introduction and modification of definitions under the erstwhile TISPRO regulations will be discussed in greater detail in the later part of this paper.\nChanges related to Foreign Venture Capital Investors (\u201cFVCIs\u201d)\nFVCIs had the option of investing in start-ups\u2019 \u201csecurities\u201d under TISPRO. Under TISPRO, the word \u201csecurities\u201d was not defined. An FVCI may invest in \u201cequity or equity linked instruments or debt instruments issued by an Indian \u201cstart-up,\u201d regardless of the sector in which the start-up is engaged,\u201d according to the new NDI Rules. In the NDI Rules, the term \u201cequity or equity-linked instrument\u201d or \u201cdebt instrument issued by an Indian start-up\u201d is used instead of the word \u201csecurities\u201d as it was in TISPRO. The NDI Rules have also added the phrase \u201cirrespective of the sectors\u201d as a new inclusion. This is a welcome change in terms of encouraging foreign investments in Indian startups and also aligns with the government\u2019s policy of liberalizing and globalizing the financial sector.\nIncreased Government Control\nOne of the striking changes brought about by the Non-Debt Instruments Rules is the Central Government\u2019s increased control over foreign investments. This is evident in the introduction of the phrases \u201cand in consultation with the Central Government\u201d in a number of provisions, including those pertaining to the approval of transfers not covered by general permission and the divestment of investments by Non-Resident Indians (\u201cNRIs\u201d) or Overseas Citizens of India (\u201cOCIs\u201d) in the event of a breach of the relevant limits or sectoral caps, and issuance of shares in case of swap of equity instruments. This virtually eliminates the RBI\u2019s autonomy and discretionary powers, and it raises the question of how much longer the approval process will become since the existing process was cumbersome and time taking.\nChanges regarding the acquisition of immovable property \nThe combining of laws relating to the acquisition or transfer of immovable property, which was formerly covered under the ATIP Regulations, with provisions relating to foreign investment is one of the most drastic changes brought about by these Non-Debt Instrument Rules. While the rules regarding the purchase or transfer of real estate by a person residing outside of India have not changed significantly, such a transaction would now be seen as a non-debt investment.\nThe clarity in Debt Instrument Regulations \nThe rules governing investments in debt, non-convertible debentures, security receipts, and other government securities by FPIs, NRIs, OCIs, foreign central banks, and multilateral development banks, among others, have been shifted from the TISPRO Regulations to the Debt Regulations.\nThe Regulations now go a step further and permit an authorized dealer to allow remittances, both inward and outward, related to permitted derivatives transactions. Previously, the TISPRO Regulations only allowed an authorized dealer to allow the remittance of sale proceeds of a security (net of applicable taxes) to the seller of shares resident outside India.\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGES IN THE FEMA ACT\nThere are interpretative issues however even in these rules and regulations. Firstly, neither the FEMA nor the Finance Act of 2015 contains a definition of debt instruments or non-debt instruments. The Debt Instrument Regulations and Non-Debt Instrument Rules both contain definitions of the term \u2018debt instruments\u2019 but both the legislations define the term very differently. The Non-Debt Instruments Rules define debt instruments as all those instruments other than the non-debt instruments defined in clause 2 (a) of these rules. The Debt Instruments Regulations define debt instruments as those which are listed in Schedule I of the Regulations. Schedule I of the Regulations have different instruments for different classes of overseas investors [FPI, NRI\u2019S (both on repatriation and non-repatriation basis and Foreign Central Banks or a Multilateral Development Bank]. It is clearly visible that the instruments which are classified as debt instruments for the purposes of Non-Debt Instrument Rules need not be considered debt instruments for the purposes of Debt Instrument Regulations. The problem this dichotomy creates is that which instruments are referred to as \u2018debt instruments\u2019 in Sections 2A, 6, and 46 of the FEMA 1999 is left open to interpretation. The Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Rules, 2022 (\u2018ODI Rules\u2019) seem to address this issue as these specifically list the instruments which shall be considered as debt instruments and non-debt instruments for the purposes of the sub-section (7) to Section 6 of the FEMA Act, 1999. As per the ODI Rules Government bonds, corporate bonds, all tranches of securitisation structure which are not equity tranche, borrowings by firms through loans and depository receipts whose underlying securities are debt securities are considered as debt instruments while all investments in equity in incorporated entities (public, private, listed and unlisted), capital participation in Limited Liability Partnerships, all instruments of investment as recognised in the Foreign Direct Investment policy from time to time, investment in units of Alternative Investment Funds and Real Estate Investment Trust and Infrastructure Investment Trusts, investment in units of mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Fund which invest more than fifty percent in equity, the junior-most layer (i.e., equity tranche) of securitisation structure, acquisition, sale or dealing directly in immovable property, contribution to trusts; and depository receipts issued against equity instruments are considered as non-debt instruments. The Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Regulations, 2022 (\u2018ODI Regulations\u2019) which were subsequently issued by the RBI also accept the definition in the ODI Rules. These new set of legislations seem to solve the problem from a practical standpoint as the latest definition should be referred to by the practitioners, businesses, and policy analysts dealing with FEMA but the interpretative issue highlighted in this paper still remains as the ODI Rules and ODI Regulations do not repeal or suppress the NDI Rules or DI Regulations.\u00a0 This creates a regulatory issue as well because the governing powers of the RBI and central government post the foreign exchange regime overhaul has been bifurcated on the very basis of debt instruments and non-debt instruments and an ambiguity regarding the classification of these instruments is likely to cause regulatory issues in future.\nThere is a similar ambiguity that arises in the way the term \u2018hybrid securities\u2019 has been defined in the Non-Debt Instrument Rules. The rules define hybrid securities as hybrid instruments such as optionally or partially convertible preference shares or debentures and other such instruments as specified by the Central Government from time to time, which can be issued by an Indian company or trust to a person resident outside India. Not only is the definition itself ambiguous it also appears from a bare reading of the definition that it is a sub-category of debt instruments, but the term has not been referred to anywhere in the Non-Debt Instrument Rules and the Debt Instrument Regulations as well do not include any mention of the term hybrid securities. This raises questions regarding how hybrid securities will be treated and makes one wonder on the very fact that why the term has been defined in the first place the government\u2019s proposal in this regard becomes further unclear as under the erstwhile TISPORO Regulations they were regulated as external commercial borrowings and classified as \u2018debt instruments The Compulsory Convertible Debentures (CCD\u2019S) which are a form of hybrid securities are listed as equity under the FDI Policy and therefore can be construed as non-debt instruments however, similar clarity cannot be said to exist for other forms of hybrid instruments and there structurization and regulation, therefore, remain ambiguous.\nThere exist certain drafting errors as well in these new sets of rules and regulations. For example, in the NDI Rules the term \u2018equity instruments\u2019 resembles the meaning assigned to the term \u2018capital instruments\u2019 in the erstwhile TISPRO regulations. However, in various provisions in the NDI rules like the definition of downstream investment and the conditionalities for investment in some sectors the term \u2018capital instruments\u2019 is still used and the same has not been defined under the NDI rules. Although it is not very difficult to decipher that this is a mere drafting error for clarity an official acknowledgement of the same would be better.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/framework-compromise-settlements-technical-write-offs.html", "title": "Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve Bank of India issued their circular DOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2023-24 dated June 08, 2023 addressed to all Regulated Entities (RE) coming under RBI on Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs.\nThe preamble of RBI circular states, \u201cThe Reserve Bank of India has issued various instructions to regulated entities (REs) regarding compromise settlements in respect of stressed accounts from time to time, including the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019 (\u201cPrudential Framework\u201d), which recognises compromise settlements as a valid resolution plan. With a view to provide further impetus to resolution of stressed assets in the system as well as to rationalise and harmonise the instructions across all REs, as announced in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released on June 8, 2023, it has been decided to issue a comprehensive regulatory framework governing compromise settlements and technical write-offs covering all the REs.\u201d\nReserve Bank initiative to come out with a FRAME WORK FOR COMPROMISE SETTLEMENTS AND TECHNICAL WRITE OFFS applicable to all banks and financial institutions coming under the regulation of RBI is a welcome step which if implemented diligently without fear, favour, prejudice and bias and uniformly and not arbitrarily or unilaterally would improve recovery of dues without the hassle of legal proceedings and without waste of time since it is also being a valid resolution plan. It seems to be easily implementable to provide further \u201cimpetus to resolution of stressed assets in the system as well as to rationalise and harmonise the instructions across all REs.\u201d\n\nThe intention behind the said circular is for an amicable settlement of all outstanding dues of stressed accounts for mutual benefit by creating a win-win situation with the mutual understanding and co-operation between the lender and borrower based on TRUST, FAITH, HOPE and UNDERSTANDING for the veritable realisation of objectives of the settlement arrived at through best of intentions and purest of motives keeping the relationship intact forever. If only the banker and the borrower can understand their respective roles and duties and responsibilities and how are they interconnected with their mutual welfare in their correct perspectives, then only can there be an everlasting enduring and endearing relationship and solving problems for mutual benefit and progress. The Lender and the borrower should firmly believe in this dictum.\nOne of the best ways of solving the delinquent nonperforming asset problem is by way of compromise settlement which will amicably find solutions to the resolution of nonperforming asset for mutual benefit of the lender and the borrower avoiding the pit falls of financial duress and the biggest existential threat to entrepreneur sustenance and organisational survival. But the success of compromise settlement depends on understanding and arriving at the basic and important norms of settlement.\nKYC norms have been introduced in the financial sector. But what is important is that knowing the customer and understanding the customer are two different things. In fact understanding the customer is more important than mere knowing the customer since to understand and to be understood are the basis of human relationship. It is built on the power of communication. It is communication that wins over people and creates an endearing and enduring interpersonal relationship. Those who have mastered its effective use can change their own experience of the world and the world\u2019s experience of them. All behaviour and feelings find their original roots in some form of communication. Those who are successful know to use this power effectively. Effective communication leads to understand the situations in their correct perspectives and prospective. It paves to way to accept the realities of the situations under the prevailing environment. Acceptance makes way to finding practical and pragmatic solutions leading to mutually beneficial settlements.\nThe success of compromise proposal depends on the following banking norms and humanitarian considerations.\n1. The common perception of the banks and financial institutions regulated by RBI is that the borrowers are exclusively responsible for creating Non Performing Assets (NPAs). But this perception is wrong. Sound comes only when two hands are clapped. Similarly the creation of NPA accounts is on account of wrong doings of both the banks and financial entities and the borrowers. It is universal truth that nobody is perfect. Everyone has their own faults and frailties, bias and prejudices. Banks and financial institutions also come under such internal inadequacies and service deficiencies as they are manned and managed by human beings. Understanding such inadequacies found in the banking and financial system, RBI issued a special circular  FrMC. No. BC. 1 /23.04.01D/2004-05 dated August 7, 2004 addressed to The Chief Executives All Commercial Banks on Deficiencies found in sanctioning of loans and monitoring of borrowal accounts by banks / Financial Institution where in it states, \u201cit has been observed that in many reported frauds, there were inherent weaknesses at the stages of sanction and post disbursement follow up of advances which ultimately culminated in perpetration of frauds in the accounts\u201d. Thus it very clear and without any ambiguity that the banks and financial institutions also are responsible to create nonperforming assets (NPA). Compliance of RBI directives and statutory rules will alone pave the way for an amicable settlement upholding the Constitutional rights of EQUALITY BEFORE LAW. Besides, a reference to RBI circular No. DoS. CO.PPG./SEC.02/11.01.005/2020-21 dated September 11, 2020 on Compliance functions in banks and Role of Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) gives better idea about implementation of compliance function. \n2. The first step is to ensure the banks and financial institutions have complied with all the RBI guidelines and other statutory rules as enumerated by RBI in their compliance circular.\n3. The reasons that led to the account being classified as NPA be analysed to make sure whether the defaulter borrower is a wilful defaulter or defaulter due to circumstances beyond their control. If the borrower is a wilful defaulter or a fraudster, no remedy is available to him. If the defaulter is a victim of circumstances beyond his control, all efforts should be taken to take the account out of the NPA status or to offer a reasonable, affordable and implementable compromise settlement without much loss and damages to the borrower so that the borrower can also survive.\n4. The right of the bank to recover their dues is derived out of their duties and responsibilities to be performed first and their duties and responsibilities being compliance of RBI guidelines and other statutory provisions as substantiated under their compliance circulars.\n5. Other important features are as stated below.\n(i) Whether the borrower has the capacity to pay the settled amount for which the banks are mandated to arrive at a realistic cash flow.\n(ii) The repayment schedule is to be fixed depending on the realistic cash flow for the fulfilment of the task without any impediment.\n(iii) The rate of interest to be charged should be affordable.\n(iv) All types of concessions possible should be made available since the effectiveness of settlement proposal also depends on concessions to be given.\n(v) The biggest impediment to the compromise settlement is valuation of collateral securities particularly immovable assets. If settlement is to be based on the value of the collateral securities in the form of immovable assets, then the equity of the settlement will be lost and the defaulted borrower who opts for compromise settlement will be a huge loser. Any settlement based on the value of collateral security alone will not be fair and equitable settlement. The most important aspect is that the outstanding liability to be settled in most of the cases is the accrued and accruing interest on the loan. Once the account is classified as NPA the cash generation is almost stopped and the activities will come to a standstill but the interest will go on mounting with penal interest added to along with all other charges. Hence, the recover should be done with a human touch.\n(vi) The most important aspect is that the banks and financial institutions should not behave like real estate agents or collection agents to recover the debts devoid of any sensitivity and transparency.\n(vii) Operating any business in today\u2019s economic environment means managing cash flow. Companies looking only at their earnings and not managing cash flow cannot and will not survive in today\u2019s economy where short-term operational loans are not often readily available. Hence managing a very positive cash flow is an essential and an inevitable necessity for any business organisation.\n(viii) Any compromise settlement or the recovery should not lead to the violation of fundamental rights, constitutional rights, human rights, consumer rights etc. The motto of recovery should be \u201clive and let live\u201d.\n(ix) In this connection a reference may kindly be made to RBI circular No.BP.BC.45/21.04.048/2018-19 June 7, 2019 Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets where in it states under Para No. 13 at the foot note {7} \u201cRestructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower\u2019s financial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll over of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an account in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months.\u201d\n6. The entrepreneur also has invested his capital and self-made assets and margin money in his business and he is also a job provider. Hence, while recovering the dues, he and his employees should not be deprived of their livelihood and thrown into the streets overnight.\n7. A reference may be made to the notification issued by Press Information Bureau, Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises dated 29.05.2015 on Framework for Revival and habilitation of MSMEs which consists of following features.\n(i) Identification of incipient stress.\n(ii)\u00a0 Committees for Distressed Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.\n(iii) Corrective Action Plan (CAP) by the Committee.\n(iv) Options under Corrective Action Plan (CAP).\n(v) Restructuring Process.\n(vi) Prudential Norms on Asset Classification and Provisioning.\n(vii) Wilful Defaulters and Non-Cooperative Borrowers.\n(viii) Review: In case the Committee decides that recovery\u00a0 action\u00a0 is\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 initiated\u00a0 against\u00a0 an\u00a0 enterprise,\u00a0\u00a0 such enterprise may request for a review of the decision by the Committee within a period of fifteen working\u00a0 days from the date of receipt of the decision of the Committee. Application filed under this section shall be decided by the Committee within a period of thirty days from the date of filing and if as a consequence of such review, the Committee decides to pursue a fresh corrective action plan for revival of the enterprise shall apply accordingly.\nIt is expected that above Framework help the lenders and debtors in revival and rehabilitation of enterprises and shall unlock the potential of particularly MSMEs.\n8. Supreme Court judgment in the matter of Shiva Shakti Sugars Ltd vs. Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd (CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5041 OF 2014, 5042 OF 2014 and 5043 OF 2014, judgment dated 09.05.2017) states as per the following very important extracts highlighting \u201ceconomic interest competes with the rights of people, the courts need to take a balanced approach.\u201d \nThe top court said. \u201cFirst duty of the court is to decide the case by applying the statutory provisions,\u201d the court further said, \u201cHowever, on the application of law and while interpreting a particular provision, economic impact / effect of a decision, wherever warranted, has to be kept in mind.\u201d The Apex Court observes again, \u201c38) Even in those cases where economic interest competes with the rights of other persons, need is to strike a balance between the two competing interests and have a balanced approach. That is the aspect which has been duly taken care of in the instant case, as would be discernible from the concluding paragraph of this judgment.\u201d\n\u201c39) Although law and economics traces back to the period of Jeremy Bentham3, i.e. 18th century, in the last few decades, interplay between law and economics has gained momentum throughout 3 Utilitarian Theory, which is essentially economic theory.\u201d \nThe aforesaid judgment has been quoted here because the borrowers\u2019 cases are coming under \u201ceconomic impact\u201d on account of the fact that even if a restructuring is to be initiated the accounts cannot be retrieved from the NPA status. Since many of the borrowers are coming under the category of MSME, the notification issued by Press Information Bureau, Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises dated 29.05.2015 on Framework for Revival and habilitation of MSMEs will be applied under \u201cOptions under Corrective Action Plan (CAP):\u00a0The options under Corrective Action Plan (CAP) by the Committee may include: (i) Rectification \u2013 regularize the account so that the account does not slip into the non-performing asset (NPA) category, (ii) restructuring the account if it is prima facie viable and the borrower is not a wilful defaulter, and (iii) recovery \u2013 Once the first two options at (i) and (ii) above are seen as not feasible, due recovery process may be resorted to.\u201d One of the very important recovery process is resorting to One Time Settlement (OTS).\n9. It is the universal truth that construction takes its own time whereas destruction is instant. Construction brings in investments through which development and progress and prosperity are achieved but destruction nullifies all achievements. This is very much true in any banking lending and recovery procedures and proceedings. A dispassionate and without prejudice view if taken about the objective of the banks and borrower entrepreneurs, it is evident that their activities are complimentary to each other and not contradictory. They are interdependent on each other and not independent of each other. They are supportive of each other and not opposing each other. Their sustenance and progress depend on each other and not on weakening each other. They have necessarily and inevitably to work together unitedly and in unison to achieve their common objective of building up a robust economy making the nation a foremost global economic power. Therefore any recovery proceedings undertaken by the bank should ensure that the interest of the bank and the borrower should not be jeopardized. Through mutual understanding, cooperation between the lender and the borrower and for mutual benefit, they should jointly explore new opportunities for development and progress and stability with sincerity of purpose and purity of heart and with the objective of working together unitedly and in unison to create a robust economy for the nation. The only way the bank and the borrower can achieve their common objective mutually acceptable solution of an amicable settlement is through compromise settlement to create a win-win situation.\n10. \u201cEconomic policymakers require an enormous dose of humility, openness to various alternatives (including the possibility that they might be wrong), and a willingness to experiment,\u201d Raghuram Rajan, ex- Governor of Reserve Bank of India wrote in a column on the Project Syndicate website. Regarding NPA recovery he said, \u201cWe have to improve the efficiency of the recovery system, especially at a time of economic uncertainty like the present. Recovery should be focused on efficiency and fairness \u2013 presenting the value of underlying assets and jobs where possible, even while redeploying unviable assets to new uses and compensating fairly. All this should be done while ensuring that contractual priorities are met. The system has to be tolerant of genuine difficulties while coming down on mismanagement or fraud,\u201d he said. The then RBI Governor had given the clarion call on a positive note to the banks and financial institutions with regard to the recovery of dues.\n11. That Supreme Court of India in the matter of Mardia Chemicals judgment states,(Mardia Chemicals Ltd., v. Union of India reported in AIR 2004 Supreme Court 2371 : (2004) 4 S.C.C. 311), \u201cLiquidity of finances and flow of money is essential for any healthy and growth-oriented economy. But certainly, what must be kept in mind is that the law should not be in derogation of the rights which are guaranteed to the people under the Constitution. The procedure should also be fair, reasonable and valid, though it may vary looking to the different situations needed to be tackled and object sought to be achieved.\u201d It is thus obvious that whatever actions that the banks and financial institutions initiate to recover the dues should not be in derogation of the rights which are guaranteed to the people under the constitution coming under the purview of Fundamental Rights and also should not infringe in to the Human Rights and Principles of Natural Justice.\nThe judgment further states while upholding the validity of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002(54 of 2002) is as follows: \u201cThe financial institutions, namely the lenders owe a duty to act fairly and in good faith. There has to be a fair dealing between the parties and the financing companies/institutions are not free to ignore performance of their obligation as a party to the contract. They cannot be free from it. Irrespective of the fact as to whatever may have been held in decisions of some American Courts, in view of the facts and circumstances and the terms of the contracts and other details relating to those matters, that may or may not strictly apply, nonetheless, even in absence of any such decisions or legislation, it is incumbent upon such financial institutions to act fairly and in good faith complying with their part of obligations under the contract. This is also the basic principle of concept of lender\u2019s liability. It cannot be a one-sided affair shutting out all possible and reasonable remedies to the other party, namely, borrowers and assume all drastic powers for speedier recovery of NPAs. Possessing more drastic powers calls for exercise of higher degree of good faith and fair play. The borrowers cannot be left remediless in case they have been wronged against or subjected to unfair treatment violating the terms and conditions of the contract. They can always plead in defense deficiencies on the part of the banks and financial institutions.\u201d\n12. Last but not the least what the author advocates is, \u201cConscience Cum Conscious Banking\u201d will usher in an environment of goodwill and mutual respect among banks / financial institutions and the customers without the feeling of being abused, shamed and threatened. It also inculcates a sense of belonging among the executives, employees and the customers leading to understanding the respective roles and mutual obligations and contributions towards the health and wealth of economy and the society alike. Further they would hold themselves and each other accountable for adhering to some set of agreed-upon values and ethics and for working toward an agreed-upon vision. Deviations and errors would be considered as an opportunity for learning and growth, rather than an excuse for blame and punishment. This does not mean that there won\u2019t be any problems. In an uncertain and volatile business environment nobody can predict precisely the future outcome. But with trust and mutual understanding based on the culture, values and ethics that they developed, timely actions will be initiated tide over the problems and to achieve the goals of mutual welfare keeping the national interest above all. A Conscience Cum Conscious Banking will create an everlasting relationship between the bank and the customer with mutual help and respect which will also enable Recovery with Human Touch. \n(The author invites comments from readers and he can be contacted through his email trrk1941@gmail.com)\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}, {"link": "https://taxguru.in/rbi/rbi-fair-lending-practice-penal-charges-loan-accounts.html", "title": "RBI: Fair Lending Practice \u2013 Changes in Penal Charges for Loan Accounts", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are writing to inform you about the recent guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide RBI/2023-24/53 DoR.MCS.REC.28/01.01.001/2023-24 dated August 18, 2023, regarding fair lending practices and the imposition of penal charges on loan accounts. These guidelines, effective from January 1, 2024, are applicable to all Commercial Banks (including Small Finance Banks, Local Area Banks, and Regional Rural Banks), Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, NBFCs (including HFCs), and All India Financial Institutions (EXIM Bank, NABARD, NHB, SIDBI, and NaBFID).\nThe RBI recognizes the significance of ensuring transparency and reasonableness in the disclosure of penal charges. The guidelines aim to promote credit discipline without penal charges being utilized as a means of revenue enhancement. To address varying practices among financial institutions and prevent customer grievances, the following instructions have been issued for your consideration and implementation:\n1. Treatment of Penal Charges: Penal charges for non-compliance with material terms and conditions of the loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as \u2018penal charges\u2019 and not as \u2018penal interest\u2019 added to the interest rate on advances. These charges shall not be capitalized, meaning no additional interest will be calculated on them. Normal procedures for interest compounding in the loan account remain unaffected.\n2. Additional Interest Component: Financial institutions are prohibited from introducing any extra component to the interest rate and are required to adhere to these guidelines both in letter and spirit.\n3. Board-Approved Policy: Financial institutions are to formulate a Board-approved policy on penal charges or similar charges on loans, regardless of nomenclature.\n4. Reasonable Quantum: The quantum of penal charges should be reasonable and proportional to the non-compliance of material terms and conditions of the loan contract. These charges should not be discriminatory within a particular loan/product category.\n5. Individual Borrowers: For loans sanctioned to \u2018individual borrowers, for purposes other than business,\u2019 penal charges shall not exceed those applicable to non-individual borrowers for similar non-compliance.\n6. Disclosure and Communication: The quantum and rationale behind penal charges must be transparently communicated to customers in the loan agreement, most important terms & conditions, and Key Fact Statement (KFS), if applicable. This information should also be displayed on the financial institution\u2019s website under \u2018Interest Rates and Service Charges.\u2019\n7. Communication of Charges: Applicable penal charges should be communicated to borrowers when reminders for non-compliance are sent. Instances of levying penal charges and the reasons for them should also be conveyed.\n8. Effective Date: These instructions will be effective from January 1, 2024. Financial institutions should revise their policy framework as necessary and implement these guidelines for all fresh loans availed or renewed from this date. For existing loans, the transition to the new penal charges regime should be ensured on the next review or renewal date, or within six months from the effective date of this circular, whichever is earlier.\nThese instructions have been issued under relevant sections of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and the National Housing Bank Act, 1987.

As per the Reserve Bank of India, digital lending is defined as a remote and automated lending process, largely by use of seamless digital technologies for customer acquisition, credit assessment, loan approval, disbursement, recovery, and associated customer service.[ii] The DLG guidelines are applicable only to digital lending and arrangements that would be covered under the scope of the term \u2018digital lending\u2019 and the guarantees that don\u2019t fall within the purview of digital lending would be treated as synthetic securitisation\nDLG is an arrangement between a bank/Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) and a Fintech company where the Fintech Company agrees to compensate (up to a certain percentage of the loan) to the bank/NBFC in case the customer (borrower) defaults. The RBI guidelines cover some of the very important aspects that had been long demanded by the industry. It provided for accepted forms of DLG for regulated entities (i.e. Banks/NBFCs), maximum DLG cover for an outstanding loan, maximum invocation period (120 days), eligibility criteria for DLG providers and the compliances they need to make.\nThe guidelines also provide exemptions to certain types of guarantees like the guarantee schemes of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises, credit guarantee fund trust for low income housing and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd and credit guarantee provided by BIS (Bank of International Settlement). Moreover, the lending service provider has to be incorporated as a company and such a provision is provided to enhance protection and deter the individual smaller agents to function as a lending service provider.\nThe present guidelines provides the mandatory requirement that the DLG arrangements msut be backed by a contract between the regulated entity and the DLG provider. The maximum DLG cover that can be provided for a particular loan portfolio is 5%. The RBI has also provided the required compliances by the regulated entity with respect to DLG providers like having a board-approved DLG policy in place. Conducting adequate due diligence of the DLG providers and establishing a customer protection and grievance redressal measures.\nSo, apart from the fact that these guidelines are a boost to the players in the fintech industry, it is definitely going to serve the larger purpose of serving the credit-starved sections of Indian society by enhancing credit penetration and the various compliances provided for in the guidelines will definitely go a long way to promote customer protection and transparency.\n[i]\u00a0RBI Guidelines on Default Loss Guarantee (DLG) in Digital Lending\n[ii]\u00a0RBI Guidelines on Digital Lending\nAuthor \u2018Arnab Goswami\u2019 is a 3rd year student at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun.\n", "table": [], "table_c": []}]
